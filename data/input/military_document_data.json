Todd Dow Lehrschrift Seiten Anbieter www rifle craft com Sprache Englisch Der Autor Todd Dow vertreibt \u00fcber seine Webseite www rifle craft com die von ihm entworfenen Schie\u00dfriemen RS und RS sowie dazu passendes Zubeh\u00f6r Seit dem Jahr bietet er auf dieser Plattform die Lehrschrift \u201eSlings In The Wild\u201c kostenlos \u00fcber den Warenkorb zum Download an Auf insgesamt Seiten behandelt er darin den praktischen Nutzen von Schie\u00dfriemen beim feldm\u00e4\u00dfigen Gebrauch Das in Kapitel untergliederte Werk ist sinnvoll und reichhaltig mit Farbaufnahmen bebildert Todd Dow stellt die Nutzung eines Schie\u00dfriemens undogmatisch als eine Option von mehreren vor Im Vergleich zu anderen Schie\u00dfhilfen haben diese f\u00fcr ihn den Vorteil des geringen Gewichts und der Platzersparnis sodass sie ohne jeglichen Mehraufwand st\u00e4ndig mit der Waffe mitgef\u00fchrt werden k\u00f6nnen Die Verwendung eines Schie\u00dfriemens im Anschlag kommt f\u00fcr ihn immer dann in

Selbstladegewehrs zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen tritt der Schie\u00dfriemen f\u00fcr Dow in den Hintergrund Ein Grund daf\u00fcr ist die erreichbare durchschnittliche Sch\u00fctzenstreuung Todd Dow hat in den ausf\u00fchrlich beschriebenen Selbstversuchen f\u00fcr sich erkannt dass die Nutzung eines Schie\u00dfriemens im Vergleich zum Verzicht auf diese Hilfe seine Streuung mit dem Gewehr in den verschiedenen Anschl\u00e4gen halbiert Die Nutzung einer stabilen Gewehrauflage etc f\u00fchrt seinen Erkenntnissen nach zu einer weiteren Halbierung dieser Streukreise In seiner Lehrschrift nutzt er neben seinen eigenen Schie\u00dfriemen auch andere wie den Sling den USGI Sling sowie den Ching Sling Eine Einteilung der verschiedenen Schie\u00dfriemen nach ihrem Typ erfolgt genauso wie die Darstellung von Gemeinsamkeiten und Unterschieden Vor und Nachteilen Von ihrem Nutzen her seien alle Schie\u00dfriemen im Prinzip gleich Von der Einstellung \u00fcber die richtige Nutzung zur korrekten Einnahme von verschiedenen Anschl\u00e4gen werden alle wichtigen Punkte betrachtet und Schritt f\u00fcr Schritt bebildert Dabei geht der Autor auf Feinheiten wie die Unterschiede bei verschiedentlicher Montage oder auch die richtige Positionierung von Riemenb\u00fcgelhaltern umfassend ein Mit den Inhalten seiner Lehrschrift und einem unkomplizierten Schreibstil gibt er dem Leser eine detaillierte Anleitung um ein besserer Gewehrsch\u00fctze werden zu k\u00f6nnen Todd Dow hat mit \u201eSlings In The Wild\u201c das Standardwerk f\u00fcr den feldm\u00e4\u00dfigen Gebrauch von

tausende Pleiten Auch die Autoindustrie durchf\u00e4hrt ein tiefes Tal Die ohnehin schon angeschlagene Branche verzeichnet Verkaufseinbr\u00fcche Entlassungen bei Herstellern und Zulieferern wurden bereits angek\u00fcndigt oder sind zu erwarten Autoh\u00e4ndler \u00e4chzen \u00fcber nicht verkaufte Autos die ihnen die H\u00f6fe verstopfen Die Reaktion der Branche ist erwartbar In der Talkshow Anne Will forderte Deutschlands oberste Auto Lobbyistin VDA Chefin Hildegard M\u00fcller es solle Kaufpr\u00e4mien f\u00fcr Autos geben Am besten f\u00fcr alle also nicht nur f\u00fcr Elektro und Hybridautos sondern auch f\u00fcr Diesel und Benziner Wie Automarkt Experte Professor Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer feststellt hat die Branche diese Kaufpr\u00e4mien offenbar schon eingeplant Sie haben ihre Rabattaktionen derzeit stark eingeschr\u00e4nkt obwohl in einer Krise eigentlich das Gegenteil zu erwarten w\u00e4re Entweder die Autobauer sitzen Corona im deutschen Automarkt in aller Ruhe aus oder man wartet auf den Pr\u00e4mien Impuls aus Berlin bemerkt Dudenh\u00f6ffer Mischung aus gelenkter Wirtschaft und \u00d6ko Utopia Der ebenfalls zu Anne Will geladene Finanzminister Scholz lie\u00df VDA Chefin M\u00fcller \u00fcbrigens auflaufen Ich glaube dass viele verstanden haben dass wenn man Staatshilfe in Anspruch nimmt das Zahlen von Dividenden und Boni eine sehr komplizierte Idee ist um es einmal h\u00f6flich auszudr\u00fccken so Scholz Der Beifall daf\u00fcr war ihm sicher vor allem bei denjenigen die glauben dass die Krise eine Chance sei endlich weniger Kapitalismus einzuf\u00fchren Was insofern irritiert als dass bisher noch aus jeder gro\u00dfen Krise der Geschichte immer die L\u00e4nder am besten herauskamen die auf marktwirtschaftliche Konzepte setzten w\u00e4hrend ihre sozialistischen oder kommunistischen Counterparts in Not und Elend landeten Gerade in Deutschland scheint es allerdings en vogue zu sein eine Mischung aus gelenkter Wirtschaft und \u00d6ko Utopia anzustreben quasi einen gr\u00fcnen Marshallplan Aus diesem Gedankengut entsprangen auch die Kaufpr\u00e4mien f\u00fcr Elektroautos und nicht zuletzt die Finanzierung der Energiewende Was zu einer bizarren Situation f\u00fchrt Otto Normal Autofahrer finanziert seinem reichen Nachbarn nicht nur seit Jahren in Form der h\u00f6chsten Stromkosten Europas seine Solar Anlage auf dem Dach

KOSTENLOS Ihre Stromrechnung und \u00fcbernimmt sogar den Vertragswechsel f\u00fcr Sie Von wegen Geld vom Staat Dazu kommt Egal ob es nun die Autohersteller oder andere Unternehmen sind die Geld bekommen weil sie gerade am lautesten schreien und von der politischen Gro\u00dfwetterlage profitieren m\u00f6chten alle begehen denselben Irrtum \u00fcbrigens auch Scholz Es gibt kein Geld vom Staat das nicht vorher dem Steuerzahler aus der Tasche gezogen wurde Gerade Deutschland belegt dabei einen absoluten Katastrophen Platz Bei kinderlosen Alleinstehenden mit durchschnittlichem Einkommen werden in Deutschland im Schnitt Prozent einbehalten wie sich aus der OECD Studie \u201eTaxing Wages\u201c ergibt Zum Vergleich Der Schnitt der OECD L\u00e4nder liegt deutlich niedriger bei Prozent Nur Belgien liegt f\u00fcr diesen Personenkreis mit einer Belastung von Prozent noch vor Deutschland Moderatorin Anne Will h\u00e4tte also mal lieber den OECD Bericht ausdrucken und Finanzminister Scholz unter die Nase reiben sollen Im \u00f6ffentlich rechtlichen Rundfunk ist da aber vielleicht einfach die Hemmschwelle zu gro\u00df denn der l\u00e4sst sich ja in Form von Rundfunkgeb\u00fchren selbst gro\u00dfz\u00fcgig vom Steuerzahler aushalten Es ist immer schwierig wenn bei solchen Sendungen vornehmlich Leute diskutieren f\u00fcr die das Geld quasi aus einem nie versiegenden Zauberbeutel auf den Boden plumpst Mehr Netto vom Brutto statt Kaufpr\u00e4mien Statt in ihrer Gutsherrenart die nicht selbst erwirtschafteten Milliarden zu verteilen sollte die Politik also lieber daf\u00fcr sorgen dass den Menschen mehr Netto vom Brutto bleibt Der Befreiungschlag aus Deutschlands maximaler Steuerlast w\u00e4re wohl die einzig wirklich gerechte Ma\u00dfnahme denn dann k\u00f6nnen die B\u00fcrger auch selbst entscheiden Investiere ich das Geld in ein Auto bei dem ich dann auch selbst entscheide ob nun ein Benziner ein Diesel oder ein Elektroauto meinen Bed\u00fcrfnissen am n\u00e4chsten kommt oder lieber in Haus oder Wohnung in die Altersvorsorge oder in etwas anderes Eine Lenkungswirkung beim Autokauf hat der Staat ja trotzdem indem Autos mit hohem Verbrauch und CO2 Aussto\u00df auch h\u00f6her besteuert werden Hier freilich muss die Bevorzugung von Elektroautos und Hybriden auf den Pr\u00fcftstand denn ein fettes Elektro SUV das Kilowattstunden auf Kilometer aus der Batterie saugt darf nicht besser gestellt sein als ein Diesel PKW mit f\u00fcnf Litern Verbrauch Abgesehen von diesen eher dezenten Leitplanken sollte sich die Politik dagegen aus der Entscheidung der B\u00fcrger ob wann und welches Auto sie sich kaufen heraushalten", "page_url":

from Sophos have been under a zero day attack that was designed to steal usernames cryptographically protected passwords and other sensitive data officials with the security firm said on Sunday The well researched and developed attack exploited a SQL injection flaw in fully patched versions of the Sophos XG Firewall With that toehold in systems it downloaded and installed a series of scripts that ultimately executed code intended to make off with users\u2019 names usernames the cryptographically hashed form of the passwords and the salted SHA256 hash of the administrator account\u2019s password Sophos has delivered a hotfix that mitigates the vulnerability Other data targeted by the attack included a list of the IP address allocation permissions for firewall users the version of the custom operating system running the type of CPU the amount of memory that was present on the device how long it had been running since the last reboot the output of the ifconfig a command line tool and ARP tables used to map IP addresses to device MAC addresses \u201cThis malware\u2019s primary task appeared to be data theft which it could perform by retrieving the contents of various database tables stored in the firewall as well as by running some operating system commands \u201d Sophos researchers wrote in Sunday\u2019s disclosure \u201cAt each step the malware collected information and then concatenated it to a file it stored temporarily on the firewall with the name Info xg \u201d The exploits also downloaded the malware from domains that appeared to be legitimate To evade detection some of the malware deleted underlying files that executed it and ran solely in memory The malicious code uses a creative and roundabout method to ensure it\u2019s executed each time firewalls are started Those characteristics strongly suggest that the threat actors spent weeks or months laying the groundwork for the attacks Sophistication The attack demonstrated that the attackers had a detailed knowledge of the Firewall that could only come from someone who had access to the software which likely required a license From there the attackers carefully studied the Firewall to find inner workings that allowed the downloading and installation of malware that used names that closely resembled names of legitimate files and processes The data the malware was designed to exfiltrate suggests the attack was designed to give attackers the means to further penetrate the organizations that used the firewall through phishing attacks and unauthorized access to user accounts and it potentially exploits targeting the firewalls or end users The Sophos post said there was no evidence the data exfiltrations were successful but it also didn\u2019t rule out that possibility The zero day vulnerability that made the attacks possible was a pre authentication SQL injection flaw found in the custom operating system that runs the firewall Sophos provided no additional details about the vulnerability SQL injection exploit flaws that execute malicious code through strings that are entered into forms contained on a vulnerable website The flaws are the result of a failure to filter out commands Pre authentication means the attacker didn\u2019t need to provide any credentials to carry execute code Users of vulnerable firewalls should ensure the hotfix is installed as soon as possible and then examine their systems for signs of compromise published on the previously mentioned post here", "page_url": "https://arstechnica.com/?p=1671396",

in US National Security Agency history researchers have discovered a new hacking group that infected targets with a previously unknown piece of advanced malware Hints of the APT\u2014short for advanced persistent threat\u2014group first emerged in April That s when a still unidentified group calling itself the Shadow Brokers published exploits and code developed by and later stolen from the NSA Titled Lost in Translation the dispatch was best known for publishing the Eternal Blue exploit that would later power the WannaCry and NotPetya worms that caused tens of billions of dollars worth of damage worldwide But the dump included something else a script that checked compromised computers for malware from a variety of APTs Researchers from Kaspersky Lab said one of the APTs described in the script started operations no later than and then vanished in the same year the Shadow Brokers post was published Dubbed DarkUniverse the group is probably tied to ItaDuke a group that has actively targeted Uyghur and Tibetans since The link assessment is based on unique code overlaps in both groups malware Going to great lengths Digging further into DarkUniverse the researchers found that the group went to great lengths to infect and surveil its targets For instance spearphishing emails were prepared separately for each target to ensure they grabbed recipients attention and induced them to open an attached Microsoft document Additionally the full featured malware was developed from scratch and evolved considerably over the eight year span of the group s known existence Each malware sample was compiled immediately before being sent to include the latest available version of the executable The attackers were resourceful and kept updating their malware during the full life cycle of their operations so the observed samples from are totally different from the initial ones from Kaspersky researchers wrote in a post published on Tuesday The suspension of its operations may be related to the publishing of the Lost in Translation leak or the attackers may simply have decided to switch to more modern approaches and start using more widely available artefacts for their operations DarkUniverse s modular malware was capable of collecting a wide range of information about the user and the infected system over an extended period of time Data collected included Keyboard input Email conversations Credentials from Outlook Express Outlook Internet Explorer Windows Mail and Windows Live Mail Windows Live Messenger and the Internet Cache Screenshots Files from specific directories Data from remote servers and shared resources A list of files of remote servers if specified credentials are valid Information from the Windows registry The malware also had the ability to change DNS settings perform basic man in the middle attacks and download and execute files Control servers were mostly stored on a mydrive ch cloud storage service DarkUniverse operators created a new account along with additional malware modules and configuration files for each target The researchers know of infected targets geolocated in Syria Iran Afghanistan Tanzania Ethiopia Sudan Russia

experimental model of a rotating detonation rocket engine which uses spinning explosions inside a ring channel to create super efficient thrust The vast majority of engines of course use combustion rather than detonation to achieve their output goals Combustion is a relatively slow and controlled process resulting from the reaction between fuel and oxygen at high temperatures and it s very well understood and mature as a technology Detonation on the other hand is fast and chaotic and much less predictable An explosion instead of a burn it is the massive discharge of energy you get when you break apart the chemical bonds holding an explosive molecule together by giving it a jolt of energy \u2013 either electrical or kinetic \u2013 in the form of a sufficiently powerful shockwave to destabilize those bonds Detonation is excellent when you want to wreck stuff in bulk and much harder to maintain precise control over But when you need to break the chains of the Earth s gravity and go to space every gram of weight makes things that much harder and more expensive Detonation releases significantly more energy from significantly less fuel mass than combustion so for more than years rocket scientists have been working on the idea of a rotating detonation rocket as a potential way to cut down weight and add thrust Mechanically simple the rotating detonation engine is dynamically very complex and requires precise timing and fuel delivery rates Professor Kareem Ahmed University of Central Florida In essence such a device starts with one cylinder inside another larger one with a gap between them and some small holes or slits through which a detonation fuel mix can be pushed Some form of ignition creates a detonation in that annular gap which creates gases that are pushed out one end of the ring shaped channel to produce thrust in the opposite direction But it also creates a shockwave that propagates around the channel at around five times the speed of sound and that shockwave can be used to ignite more detonations in a self sustaining rotating pattern if fuel is added in the right spots at the right times Pioneered by engineers at the University of Michigan in the 1950s the rotating detonation engine is tantalizingly simple in a mechanical sense but this self propagating detonation wave has proven torturously difficult to achieve and sustain Until now it seems A team at the University of Central Florida working alongside the Rotating Detonation Rocket Engine Program at the Air Force Research Laboratory claims to have built and tested a working laboratory model It s a inch copper test rig using a mix of hydrogen and oxygen for fuel which is the highest performing rocket fuel for upper stage rocket engines The study presents for the first time experimental evidence of a safe and functioning hydrogen and oxygen propellant detonation in a rotating detonation rocket engine says Kareem Ahmed an assistant professor in UCF s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering who led the research The detonation is sustained continuously until you cut off the fuel We have tested up to lbf but the thrust increases linearly with the propellant mass flow The three inch copper test rig has developed up to lbf but thrust will increase in a linear fashion as more fuel is added Professor Kareem Ahmed University of Central Florida The secret according to the researchers was as simple as a tune up We have to tune the sizes of the jets releasing the propellants to enhance the mixing for a local hydrogen oxygen mixture Ahmed says So when the rotating explosion comes by for this fresh mixture it s still sustained Because if you have your composition mixture slightly off it will tend to deflagrate or burn slowly instead of detonating Just a few months prior a number of US rocket engine experts had publicly declared that hydrogen oxygen detonation engines were not possible Ahmed tells New Atlas However the paper presents experimental evidence and demonstrated without a doubt that detonation of oxygen and hydrogen are occurring within a rotating detonation rocket engine These research results already are having repercussions across the international research community says William Hargus lead of the Air Force Research Laboratory s Rotating Detonation Rocket Engine Program who is a co author of the study Several projects are now re examining hydrogen detonation combustion within rotating detonation rocket engines because of these results I am very proud to be associated with this high quality research Ahmed tells us this engine design is being evaluated as a possible replacement for Aerojet Rocketdyne s RL rocket which was first developed in Modern versions are still in production for the upper stages of Atlas V and Delta IV rockets with further versions under development for the Exploration OmegA and Vulcan rockets but a proven rotating detonation rocket engine could be a real game changer The U S Air Force is targeting a rocket launch flight test by says Ahmed and we are contributing to achieving that goal While space propulsion is the key driver for this research it also has potential terrestrial uses in other cases where high power and low fuel consumption could make a big difference In the Naval Research Laboratory estimated that rotating detonation engines could save the Navy percent off a US billion annual fuel bill if they were retrofitted in place of the gas turbine engines that run over of its large ships They could also potentially be used in hypersonic and supersonic flights or even electric power generation and Ahmed tells us the design has potential as a booster stage engine as well but it d require a different type of propellant See a short slow motion video of

failure This week SpaceX workers in South Texas loaded the third full scale Starship prototype\u2014SN3\u2014onto a test stand \u200bat the company s Boca Chica launch site On Wednesday night they pressure tested the vehicle at ambient temperature with nitrogen and SN3 performed fine On Thursday night SpaceX began cryo testing the vehicle which means it was loaded again with nitrogen but this time it was chilled to flight like temperatures and put under flight like pressures Unfortunately a little after 2am local time SN3 failed and began to collapse on top of itself It appeared as if the vehicle may have lost pressurization and become top heavy Shortly after the failure SpaceX s founder and chief engineer Elon Musk said on Twitter We will see what data review says in the morning but this may have been a test configuration mistake A testing issue would be good in the sense that it means the vehicle itself performed well and the problem can be more easily addressed This is the third time a Starship has failed during these proof tests that precede engine tests and potentially flight tests Multiple sources indicated that had these preliminary tests succeeded SN3 would have attempted a meter flight test as early as next Tuesday Here s a recap of SpaceX s efforts to test full size Starships to date Starship Mk1 Construction began in December Failed during pressure test in November Starship SN1 Construction began in October Failed during a pressure test on Feb Starship SN2 Construction began in Feb After SN1 failure was converted into a test bed for thrust puck at base of rocket Passed test on March and was retired Starship SN3 Construction began in March Cryogenic test failure on April Starship SN4 Construction began in March Testing begins later this month This failure has to be a disappointment in that the prototype rocket failed for a third time before getting to Raptor engine tests And after the SN1 failure Musk said he told his engineers In the future you treat that rocket like it\u2019s your baby and you do not send it to the test site unless you think your baby\u2019s going to be OK This baby was not OK However the reality is that SpaceX is now hardware rich having built up a capacity in South Texas to rapidly build newer and more advanced prototypes of the Starship vehicle The likelihood of failures is baked into a privately funded program that builds tests fails learns and then restarts the cycle So Musk and his engineers will learn from this failure and likely begin to test SN4 later this month Listing image by Trevor Mahlmann for

Trademark Office USPTO has ruled that artificial intelligence systems cannot be credited as an inventor in a patent the agency announced earlier this week The decision came in response to two patents \u2014 one for a food container and the other for a flashing light \u2014 that were created by an AI system called DABUS Among the USPTO\u2019s arguments is the fact that US patent law repeatedly refers to inventors using humanlike terms such as \u201cwhoever\u201d and pronouns like \u201chimself\u201d and \u201cherself \u201d The group behind the applications had argued that the law\u2019s references to an inventor as an \u201cindividual\u201d could be applied to a machine but the USPTO said this interpretation was too broad \u201cUnder current law only natural persons may be named as an inventor in a patent application \u201d the agency concluded \u201cUnder current law only natural persons may be named as an inventor in a patent application \u201d The patents were submitted last year by the Artificial Inventor Project Along with the patents submitted to the USPTO the team also submitted documents to the UK\u2019s Intellectual Property Office IPO and the European Patent Office EPO The IPO and EPO have already ruled that DABUS which was created by AI researcher Stephen Thaler cannot be listed as an inventor based on similar legal interpretations The USPTO asked the public for opinions on the topic last November The Artificial Inventor Project is not arguing that an AI should own a patent just that it should be listed as an inventor MIT Technology Review notes It argues that this might be necessary when hundreds or even thousands of employees have contributed code to a system like IBM\u2019s Watson supercomputer before the computer itself then goes on to solve a problem If no human was involved closely enough with an invention to claim credit for it then the group fears it may be impossible to patent it at all The project also argues that allowing AI to be listed as an inventor would incentive innovation since the value these machines are adding would be more clearly recognized \u201cIf you make a point of recognizing how valuable a machine has been in the creative process that machine will inevitably become more valuable \u201d the Artificial Inventor Project\u2019s Ryan Abbott told the Financial Times last year Unless the law changes in the future however artificial intelligence is likely to continue to be seen as an inventing tool rather than an inventor", "page_url":

interview with Valery Slugin the chief air defence designer of the Shipunov KBP design bureau a Tula based subsidiary of Rostec\u2019s High Precision Weapons Holding Mr Slugin a KBP veteran has been working on the PANTSIR system a multi meaning Russian word which could be translated as \u2018armour cuirass or shell\u2019 for over years during which time the system has gained the NATO nickname SA GREYHOUND The system PANTSIR S is a ground based self propelled surface to air missile gun system to safeguard a variety of objects including long range air defence systems military HQs and important civilian objects from all types of air based threats ranging from MLRS rockets and mortar shells up to cruise missiles tactical ballistic and hypersonic weapons in addition to various types of drone PANTSIR is armed with Surface to Air missiles SAMs in two containers positioned on both sides of the system turret which also employs two 30mm guns with a firing ratio up to rounds per second The initial version has been dramatically modernised and is in service with the Russian Army as its main mobile and stationary close range air defence complex while the ODINTSOVO class missile corvette became the first Russian Navy combatant armed with PANTSIR M the navalised version and it is planned to be installed aboard newly built and upgraded ships The export version called as PANTSIR SE was sold to a number of Russia\u2019s friendly nations including Iraq Syria Algeria and Ethiopia with Serbia becoming the latest customer earlier this year According to Rosoboronexport CEO Aleksander Mikheev PANTSIR has become one of the national best sellers on the world defence market Talking about PANTSIR\u2019s performance Slugin confirmed that it has shot down about drones in various locations throughout its service \u201cAbout maybe more \u201d he said to the TASS correspondent \u201cthat includes Syria and other regions \u201d Operational Service The latest attack disclosed by the Russian Foreign Ministry took place on 6th February this year when an unidentified small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle UAV was stopped by an airbase\u2019s radar when it approached the Russian installation from the northeastern part of the Mediterranean Sea after dark \u201cThe target was destroyed by the PANTSIR S missiles at a distance from the airbase No one was hurt No material damage was done \u201d the ministry official said adding that the airbase is operating routinely The previous UAV attack on the Hmeimim base were staged by militants on 19th January when the air targets were downed at a safe distance from the base according to the Russian Ministry of Defence spokesman Mr Slugin also confirmed two PANTSIR divisions were deployed to Syria a Russian one to protect military assets at Hmeimim and Tartus in addition to one operated by Syria Describing the terrorist\u2019s tactics Slugin said that they used to tie up to bombs to each UAV which made them perfectly visible on the radar screen but later the militants cut the number to just two so the UAV\u2019s signature was dramatically reduced To cope with a new threat \u201cwe had to apply some effort to teach the systems how to take down such targets \u201d stated the designer After certain improvements to both the station and missiles the system became capable of fighting mini UAVs such as the Phantom quadcopter which has a maximum size about a foot in diameter \u201cThe fight against small low speed targets is a real challenge for all radar stations and today other air defence systems are incapable of fighting such drones \u201d explained Slugin \u201cWe have adapted the radar for detecting and precisely tracking low observable targets \u201d he said adding that \u201ccertain improvements were made in the missile as well\u201d Diverse targets Talking further about the experience in Syria Mr Slugin claimed the system\u2019s guns had been used to destroy civilian vehicles being used as suicide bombs \u201cThe PANTSIR can defend itself against an infantry fighting vehicle or a \u201cjihad mobile\u201d and this is how its guns were used in Syria and this use proved to be effective \u201d he said However the missiles remain PANTSIR\u2019s main weapon \u201cWe try not to allow a target to approach the gunfire range The closest range for the missile is about km Only if something comes closer do we destroy these targets with the guns \u201d he explained He also added that PANTSIR would be capable of hitting naval surface targets \u201cI believe that PANTSIR will be able to attack surface targets on the sea too If placed on the coast preferably as high as possible the system will be able to attack surface ships ten kilometers away\u201d Slugin also commented on a video from 10th May later circulated on Twitter which showed Syrian PANTSIR S vehicles being destroyed by an Israeli guided missile presumably a SPIKE model He said that ahead of being hit the PANTSIR S had destroyed eight targets expending its ammunition stock so the combat crew had left the vehicle and were waiting for the arrival of a Transport and Loader Vehicle TLV to replenish stores which turned out to be the fatal mistake \u201cThe combat vehicle should have been removed from the firing position as soon as the set of ammunition had been spent If that had happened everything would\u2019ve been fine \u201d Slugin claimed as he gave some new details about which missiles are compatible with the system \u201cThere are two missiles that fight the entire range of targets One is standard while the other has been developed recently and is hypersonic it can reach a speed of Mach and more \u201d he said giving the system an unprecedented advantage Speaking about the PANTSIR\u2019s future development he mentioned that a new small size missile for attacking mini UAVs could be created in three to four years from now as the Research and Development work is currently on the way Evolution According to the PANTSIR\u2019s chief designer the main task now is to increase the set of ammunition to be used against small targets and simultaneously reduce costs At the moment one PANTSIR vehicle employs a standard set of ammunition consisting of missiles and artillery shells capable of destroying about targets or more but in a modern combat situation this may not be enough \u201cWe can supply the PANTSIR vehicle with four times more small missiles This will increase combat effectiveness and the number of targets that can be destroyed \u201d he went on \u201dCurrently we destroy small targets \u2026 at a distance of kilometres Why should we stuff the missile with so much explosives and equip it with extremely powerful engines It is economically feasible to make a small missile \u201d concluded Mr Slugin The designer believes that small missiles will be as long as the standard ones but smaller in diameter so instead of one standard missile the launcher will be equipped with a cluster of four \u201cHalf of the payload may be comprised of the small sized missiles allowing us to load missiles just on one side of the vehicle \u201d he noted The small missiles installation won\u2019t require major alteration \u201conly the launcher\u2019s electronic brain will have to be changed \u201d Mr Slugin pointed out Another improvement to the PANTSIR system comes with the future TLV capability for firing missiles while receiving data on targets from the system\u2019s main radar unit \u201cWe plan to develop a new support vehicle that will carry an even bigger payload \u201d Slugin said adding that the new \u201cTLV may become a transporting combat vehicle \u201d According to the designer the TLV will receive target designation from the main unit but will fire missiles on its own and carry twice as many missiles as the main unit compared to PANTSIR\u2019s Keeping in mind the PANTSIR\u2019s excellent performance today as well as its post upgrade capabilities the system can remain Russia\u2019s bestseller for at least another decade as according to the recent statement by Dmitry Shugaev of the Russian Federal Service on military technical cooperation \u201c countries from the Middle East South East Asia Latin America and Africa are actively negotiating for it\u201d", "page_url":

vorderen Pl\u00e4tze im Dax Die negativen Folgen d\u00fcrften sich ab dem zweiten Quartal in den Ergebnissen von MTU zeigen k\u00fcndigte Vorstandschef Reiner Winkler am Donnerstag in M\u00fcnchen an Zu einer neuen Gesch\u00e4ftsprognose f\u00fcr sieht er sich auch wegen der Unklarheiten \u00fcber die Entwicklung des Flugverkehrs noch nicht in der Lage Mithilfe einer erh\u00f6hten Kreditlinie und Kurzarbeit will er MTU ohne Staatshilfe durch die Krise steuern und m\u00f6glichst keine Jobs abbauen Die in der Krise schwer gebeutelte MTU Aktie reagierte mit Kursgewinnen auf die Neuigkeiten nachdem das Unternehmen im ersten Quartal besser abgeschnitten hatte als von Analysten erwartet Nachdem die Aktie schon am Mittwoch um mehr als zehn Prozent zugelegt hatte ging es im Mittagshandel am Donnerstag um weitere Prozent auf Euro nach oben Das Papier ist allerdings trotz der j\u00fcngsten Erholung mit einem Minus von rund Prozent der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Dax Verlierer im Corona Crash MTU Aero Engines Corona Krise trifft Unternehmen aus der Flugbranche mit am schwersten Die Corona Krise trifft Fluggesellschaften so schwer wie kaum eine andere Branche Weil Airlines in aller Welt ums \u00dcberleben ringen m\u00fcssen auch Flugzeug und Triebwerkshersteller um bestehende und k\u00fcnftige Bestellungen f\u00fcrchten Wie die gro\u00dfen Flugzeugbauer Airbus und Boeing hatte daher auch die MTU F\u00fchrung ihre im Februar ausgegebenen Gesch\u00e4ftsziele bereits im M\u00e4rz wieder kassiert und die Dividende f\u00fcr gestrichen Die Hauptversammlung ist verschoben und soll laut Winkler nun im dritten Quartal ohne pers\u00f6nliche Pr\u00e4senz der Aktion\u00e4re stattfinden \u00c4hnlich wie die Airbus Spitze baut auch die MTU F\u00fchrung darauf dass Airlines bestehende Flugzeug Bestellungen trotz der Krise in den meisten F\u00e4llen nicht stornieren sondern die Abnahme neuer Maschinen lediglich ein St\u00fcck weit in die Zukunft verschieben Bisher h\u00e4tten Kunden bei MTU noch keine Auftr\u00e4ge storniert sagte Finanzchef Peter Kameritsch Da der Flugverkehr weltweit gro\u00dfenteils am Boden liegt k\u00f6nnen Fluggesellschaften neue Jets derzeit kaum gebrauchen und wegen ihrer kritischen Finanzlage in vielen F\u00e4llen auch nur schwer bezahlen Gesch\u00e4ft im Auftaktquartal nur gering belastet durch Krise aktuelles Quartal d\u00fcrfte deutlich schlechter ausfallen Im ersten Quartal hielten sich die Auswirkungen der Krise auf das MTU Gesch\u00e4ft noch in Grenzen Der Umsatz stieg im Vergleich zum Vorjahreszeitraum um knapp Prozent auf Milliarden Euro Der bereinigte Gewinn vor Zinsen und Steuern Ebit ging um drei Prozent auf rund Millionen Euro zur\u00fcck \u00fcbertraf aber die durchschnittlichen Erwartungen von Analysten Der berichtete \u00dcberschuss sank um knapp zw\u00f6lf Prozent auf rund Millionen Euro Seit April d\u00fcrften die Corona Folgen aber deutlich durchschlagen So hatte MTU den Betrieb an den Standorten in Deutschland und Polen ab Ende M\u00e4rz f\u00fcr drei Wochen ausgesetzt und f\u00e4hrt ihn inzwischen nur schrittweise wieder hoch Derzeit liege das Niveau wieder bei rund Prozent sagte Vorstandschef Winkler MTU hat f\u00fcr die Dauer von sechs Monaten Kurzarbeit beantragt und will beim Wiederhochfahren der Produktion \u201eauf Sicht\u201c steuern MTU plant keine Stellenstreichungen auch Staatskredit bislang kein Thema Ein Stellenabbau sei derzeit nicht geplant versicherte Winkler Bevor es dazu komme biete die Kurzarbeit viele M\u00f6glichkeiten zur Anpassung Selbst Leiharbeiter Jobs will er derzeit nicht streichen Ende M\u00e4rz besch\u00e4ftigte MTU weltweit knapp Mitarbeiter ein Prozent mehr als ein Jahr zuvor Um sicher durch die Krise zu kommen will das Unternehmen bisher ungenutzte Kreditlinien \u00fcber Millionen Euro bei den Banken auf Millionen Euro aufstocken Zudem wolle MTU Anfang Mai eine Schuldverschreibung \u00fcber Millionen Euro platzieren sagte Finanzchef Kameritsch Ein Staatskredit der F\u00f6rderbank KfW ist f\u00fcr ihn bislang kein Thema \u201eWir denken dass wir selbst ohne KfW Unterst\u00fctzung gut durchkommen \u201c Unterdessen erwartet der Vorstand dass vor allem die Nachfrage im Serien und Ersatzteilgesch\u00e4ft f\u00fcr Passagierflugzeuge deutlich zur\u00fcckgeht Auch in der Triebwerkswartung geht er f\u00fcr das zweite und dritte Quartal von einer r\u00fcckl\u00e4ufigen Nachfrage aus Allenfalls von Frachtfluggesellschaften die in der Krise einen Boom erleben k\u00f6nnten hier zus\u00e4tzliche Auftr\u00e4ge kommen Im Milit\u00e4rgesch\u00e4ft wo MTU an den Antrieben f\u00fcr den Kampfjet Eurofighter und den Milit\u00e4rtransporter Airbus A400M beteiligt ist rechnet der Vorstand hingegen kaum mit negativen

resistance to common antibiotics the discovery of a new and potentially powerful antibiotic is news in itself But what makes a recent breakthrough truly revolutionary is that the promising molecule\u2014called halicin\u2014was discovered using deep learning Chemprop the neural network behind this breakthrough was developed by Kyle Swanson and Kevin Yang in when they were studying for their master\u2019s degrees at MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory CSAIL It was built from scratch and trained using everyday open source Python based technologies Swanson and Yang trained their network to identify patterns in the chemical composition of molecules that had common properties such as solubility or toxicity and thus to predict if other molecules shared those properties based on their chemical composition Their original research study was published in July The two co leads at J Clinic a collaboration of computer science and life science labs at MIT that focuses on developing AI for healthcare\u2014CSAIL professor Regina Barzilay and bioengineering professor Jim Collins \u2014wanted to investigate if Chemprop could help to discover new antibiotic treatments To test this hypothesis Swanson and Yang from Barzilay\u2019s lab were hooked up with Jonathan Stokes a postdoc antimicrobial biochemist working in Collins\u2019s lab who would lead the investigation Initially their work looked at whether Chemprop could predict if molecules could inhibit the growth of the bacterial infection Escherichia coli E coli Certain strains of E coli cause severe \u201cstomach\u201d upsets and outbreaks are common contagious and increasingly resistant to common antibiotics Chemprop not only rose to the challenge but also delivered results that surpassed all participants\u2019 expectations Under the hood of Chemprop Speaking to Behind the Code Swanson and Yang explained how Chemprop works \u201cThe core model is a type of deep neural network called a graph convolutional neural network or message passing neural network These types of neural networks are specifically designed to operate on objects that can be represented as graphs such as molecules In the case of molecules atoms are represented by nodes and bonds are represented by edges in the graph \u201cChemprop\u2019s goal is to build a representation of the molecule that can be used to predict properties like solubility or toxicity The model works by first identifying simple features of the molecule\u2019s atoms and bonds such as the type of atom\u2014carbon oxygen and so on\u2014and the type of bond such as a single or double bond \u201cThe model then performs a number of \u2018message passing\u2019 steps where it uses neural network layers to \u2018pass messages\u2019 between adjacent atoms and bonds in the molecule This message passes aggregate information across the molecule and eventually results in a single global representation of the molecule that incorporates all of the information from the individual atoms and bonds and their connections This global representation which is a single vector representing the molecule is then used by another neural network that learns to predict the relevant property from this representation \u201d Clever as Chemprop undoubtedly is it is important to remember that it was developed using everyday open source Python based technologies \u201cAll of the code is written in Python and we used PyTorch for the neural network components We also occasionally used the NumPy SciPy and scikit learn libraries throughout our code We used the Python cheminformatics toolkit RDKit to initially process the molecules and convert them into the graphs that are processed by our graph convolutional network \u201d Swanson and Yang explained Explore more in our section Tech Keeping up with Swift s latest evolutions Training Chemprop to spot E coli inhibitors The team trained the Chemprop deep learning model to recognize E coli inhibition as a property of a molecule in the same way Chemprop had identified toxicity or solubility as a property in the original research They did this using a dataset of molecules known to inhibit or fail to inhibit the growth of E coli represented as a or They then tested it on a different dataset to evaluate how well it could predict E coli inhibitors Finally they ran the model on a dataset where E coli inhibition was unknown The molecules for which Chemprop gave a high prediction of E coli inhibition were tested in the lab by Stokes In total Chemprop was tested on molecules of which inhibited E coli growth \u201cSince ordering molecules for lab testing is a lot more expensive and time consuming than running them through a computational model we filtered out molecules that are similar to known antibiotics and clustered our predictions to ensure that we tested a diverse set of molecules and had the best chance of finding promising new antibiotics \u201d recalled Swanson and Yang Chemprop gets put through its paces When the team was satisfied with the training Chemprop was put to work searching through more than million molecules\u2014using datasets from the Broad Institute\u2019s Drug Repurposing Hub and ZINC15 \u2014to look for ones with similar profiles to the inhibitors identified in testing The Drug Repurposing Hub is a database of more than drugs that have been launched and approved by regulators or have undergone some clinical development From these Chemprop revealed a shortlist of compounds with strong predictions and empirical laboratory testing revealed that on the shortlist did inhibit the growth of E coli \u201cWe prioritized strongly predicted molecules for follow up based on those that were structurally least similar to known clinical antibiotics and also in certain cases low predicted toxicity \u201d says Stokes who was the lead experimenter on the project as well as lead author of the research paper published February \u201cWe also prioritized molecules that we were able to source or synthesize fairly easily \u201d The compound that most satisfied these criteria was a drug called c Jun N terminal kinase inhibitor SU3327 which had previously been investigated as a treatment for diabetes The team renamed it halicin after HAL the AI computer in the film A Space Odyssey Lab tests conducted by Stokes showed that halicin would inhibit the growth of E coli which was the goal of the investigation But further lab tests revealed that halicin would also inhibit the growth of a range of other serious pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis which causes tuberculosis as well as \u201chospital superbugs\u201d including Clostridioides difficile C difficile \u201cThese are not similar types of bacteria which is why we were quite surprised that halicin had activity across these different types \u201d says Stokes \u201cWe are continuing to test for toxicity to human cells by halicin as well as understand its additional drug like properties If these studies go well we hope to partner with a biotech pharmaceutical or nonprofit organization to help move halicin into clinical trials \u201d Other possible antibiotics While halicin has great potential as a broad and powerful antibiotic it is not a panacea Stokes pointed out that trials did not show it to have significant impact on the bacteria pseudomonas one type of which P aeruginosa is another hospital superbug which can occur after surgery and cause infections of the blood and lungs pneumonia as well as other complications However the team has other encouraging molecules to investigate As mentioned in addition to the Drug Repurposing Hub dataset the team also put Chemprop to work on the ZINC15 database which contains hundreds of millions of purchasable \u201cdrug like\u201d compounds Chemprop provided a shortlist of just over molecules with a prediction score of is the score of a known inhibitor Filtering out those with high toxicity or similarity to common antibiotics whittled this down from to Lab tests revealed that eight of these would inhibit one or more of the five target pathogens while further research showed that two molecules were particularly powerful The combined deep learning and life sciences teams at MIT are now starting an investigation into finding antivirals to combat COVID and Chemprop is one of the tools in their arsenal The search for drugs that inhibit COVID So the big question right now of course is could Chemprop be used to find drugs that inhibit COVID \u201cYes it could be \u201d says Stokes \u201cProvided that the appropriate training data is available Chemprop could be applied in a similar way to how we used it for antibiotics to find antiviral molecules with activity against Sars CoV the virus that causes COVID \u201d MIT\u2019s J Clinic has recently launched an AI Cures team with a website of resources available for collaborating researchers These include datasets pertaining to both COVID Sars CoV and related viruses for which there is more data such as Sars Sars CoV which broke out in Asia in This will coordinate MIT\u2019s efforts to use and develop AI technologies to find antiviral molecules that may be effective with COVID infections \u201cWe aim to develop apply and make available AI tools designed to help identify or generate molecules or molecular cocktails against viral bacterial or other similar threats \u201d explains Tommi Jaakkola professor at MIT CSAIL and joint lead of the AI Cures team \u201cTraditional approaches to drug development are expensive and too slow to react to pandemics like COVID \u201cRegarding COVID specifically to contribute in the short term our goal is to search for effective and safe antiviral therapies from among already approved drugs or those that have already passed phase one clinical trials In particular we are looking for effective combinations or cocktails of such drugs \u201d And it\u2019s looking like Chemprop could help \u201cIt\u2019s a starting point for us a baseline method \u201d confirms Jaakkola \u201cIt is still useful for predictive screening of safe and effective single compounds similar to its original use for discovering antibacterial drugs We are also developing a number of more sophisticated tools \u201d We wait with bated breath to see whether Chemprop and other deep learning technologies can help scientists deliver the same breakthroughs against the deadly virus as Chemprop did against deadly bacterial infections This article is part of

transport infected patients in safety was put to its first operational use this month to evacuate three coronavirus stricken contractors from Afghanistan to Germany Air Force Air Mobility Command aircrew and medical personnel used the Transport Isolation System to carry three U S government contractors who tested positive for coronavirus on board a C Globemaster III to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center the service said in a release The mission dubbed REACH marked the first time the TIS had been used since the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the first operational use to transport coronavirus patients on board an aircraft the Air Force said The TIS which can carry two to four patients within a podlike chamber was designed to contain patients harboring infectious diseases within transport aircraft to minimize exposure of airborne and non airborne pathogens to surrounding Critical Care Air Transport Team members Aeromedical evacuation personnel and remaining aircrew Related They Weren t Gonna Stop Inside the Mile Race to Save a Wounded Soldier s Life The TIS consists of an airlock antechamber module and two isolation modules retrofitted onto an aircraft pallet which together weigh roughly pounds The pallets are watertight and equipped with high efficiency particulate air HEPA filtration system to block the spread of pathogens The C is able to transport two TIS units the system can also fly on C H and C 130J Hercules aircraft according to the service It was first delivered to the Air Force in In coordination with U S Transportation Command the 618th Air Operations Center on April sent out the first order to get a TIS trained AMC aircrew and medical team at Ramstein Air Base ready to prepare for a mission within hours the release said Officials said airmen were pre staged with a Joint Base Charleston C and TIS at Ramstein s 86th Airlift Wing in late March as the novel coronavirus continued to spread Through the meticulous effort of AMC s planners over the past few weeks in coordination with U S Transportation Command we ve produced a detailed plan that guides our crews on how to safely and effectively move ill patients to a location where they can receive greater care all while providing protection for our aircrew medical personnel and aircraft said Brig Gen Jimmy Canlas 618th AOC commander in a released statement Within hours of completing and releasing this plan to the force the crew of REACH validated the hard work of these planners by safely transporting three COVID patients nearly miles from Afghanistan to Landstuhl REACH is a great demonstration of AMC s transition to a warfighting component command with increased flexibility and speed enabling our mobility airmen to quickly answer any call for help during this global campaign to defeat COVID added AMC commander Gen Maryanne Miller Delivering hope runs deep in the blood of mobility airmen and I m in awe of what they are doing for those in need she said The Air Force has fully configured mission ready TIS units Gen Arnold Bunch head of Air Force Materiel Command told Air Force Magazine on March that in addition to the TIS researchers have also begun testing a new system known as the Portable Bio Containment Module or PBCM The system which Bunch called an urgent operational need may allow for more patients to be treated safely during transport the magazine said

Hasan Salihamidzic Es ging um die Vertragsverl\u00e4ngerung von Alphonso Davies Wie sehr er sich freue dass sich der FC Bayern und Alphonso langfristig binden Dass der J\u00e4hrige auch menschlich ein Gewinn sei Insgesamt f\u00fcnf Zeilen vier S\u00e4tze Mehr war mehr ist in diesen Tagen von Hasan Salihamidzic nicht zu h\u00f6ren und das obwohl der Sportdirektor sicher viel zu sagen h\u00e4tte und erkl\u00e4ren k\u00f6nnte gerade in der Aufregung um Manuel Neuer Dort steht Salihamidzic im Zentrum der Kritik als derjenige der Interna der Vertragsverhandlungen mit dem Bayern Kapit\u00e4n nach au\u00dfen getragen haben k\u00f6nnte Diesen Eindruck hatte zumindest Neuers Doppelinterview mit seinem Berater Thomas Kroth in der Bild am Sonntag erweckt Doch Hasan Salihamidzic schweigt Eine Anfrage des SPIEGEL f\u00fcr ein Gespr\u00e4ch mit ihm wurde abgelehnt Von Vereinsseite hie\u00df es dass Salihamidzic derzeit nicht sprechen m\u00f6chte Es sei nicht so dass es einen Maulkorb gebe und er nicht reden d\u00fcrfe Er m\u00f6chte nur einfach nicht So steht der J\u00e4hrige weiter im Fokus von Spekulationen so steht er in der \u00f6ffentlichen Wahrnehmung als der da der etwas verbockt hat Und das tat er schon oft Im Sommer sind es drei Jahre dass Salihamidzic seine Stelle als Sportdirektor beim FC Bayern antrat Er beerbte damals Matthias Sammer Bei Sammer kann man sich gut vorstellen wie er noch am Sonntag nach Neuers Interview auf dem Klubgel\u00e4nde an der S\u00e4bener Stra\u00dfe voller Emp\u00f6rung erz\u00e4hlt h\u00e4tte welch Sauerei das Gespr\u00e4ch sei und dass es nicht angehe dass ein Interview am Verein vorbei \u00fcber den Berater lanciert werde In einem w\u00fctenden aber auch in einem gut \u00fcberlegten Ton Bei der Konkurrenz fiel Salihamidzic bereits negativ auf Salihamidzic aber ist ein anderer Typ einer der sich anders ausdr\u00fcckt Seine \u00f6ffentlichen Auftritte werden oft als ungelenk manchmal ungl\u00fccklich beschrieben Als Spieler als Brazzo ackerte er in seinen neun Jahren bei den Bayern die rechte Seite hinauf und wieder herunter die Anh\u00e4nger liebten das Doch diese Liebe ist kr\u00e4ftig abgek\u00fchlt seit er Sportdirektor ist Das zeigte sich im November als er bei der Jahreshauptversammlung des Vereins immer wieder zum Buhmann gestempelt wurde und sich auch Pfiffe gegen ihn richteten Salihamidzic muss als Sportdirektor um die Anerkennung der eigenen Fans k\u00e4mpfen Oft sorgte Salihamidzic auch \u00fcber den Klub hinaus f\u00fcr Missstimmung Die Verpflichtung von Wunschspieler Callum Hudson Odoi vom FC Chelsea scheiterte wohl vor allem an seinem ungest\u00fcmen Vorpreschen wie er sp\u00e4ter auch selbst einr\u00e4umen musste Und erst in der vergangenen Woche \u00e4rgerte sich Hoffenheims Manager Alexander Rosen \u00f6ffentlich \u00fcber Salihamidzic weil die Bayern ihr U17 Talent Armando Sieb ohne Abstimmung mit der TSG zum Medizincheck nach M\u00fcnchen geholt hatten Nun eben die unwidersprochenen Mutma\u00dfungen dass er es gewesen sein k\u00f6nnte Details der Vertragsgespr\u00e4che mit Manuel Neuer nach au\u00dfen getragen zu haben Hasan Salihamidzic macht der eigentlich alles falsch Tats\u00e4chlich ist es differenzierter zu betrachten im Verein so h\u00f6rt man sch\u00e4tzt man ihn f\u00fcr seine engagierte Arbeit und seine intensive Suche nach m\u00f6glichen neuen Spielern \u2013 abgesehen davon dass auch intern von manchen stark bezweifelt wird dass wirklich er der Maulwurf in der Neuer Causa war Salihamidzic mit Erfolgen in der Transferpolitik Vor allem passte es ganz gut dass die Vertragsverl\u00e4ngerung mit Alphonso Davies ausgerechnet am Montag inmitten der ungem\u00fctlichen Neuer Debatte verk\u00fcndet wurde Schlie\u00dflich holte Salihamidzic den Kanadier nach M\u00fcnchen der nun in den Wochen vor der Corona Pause die Fans auf seiner neuen Position als linker Verteidiger begeisterte Phonzy der Publikumsliebling er ist ein Brazzo Coup Dass die Bayern Bosse den J\u00e4hrigen nun bis binden ist ein Punktgewinn f\u00fcr Salihamidzic dem man in seiner bald dreij\u00e4hrigen Amtszeit bei n\u00fcchterner Betrachtung nicht vorwerfen kann einen v\u00f6lligen Fehleinkauf verschuldet zu haben Leon Goretzka etwa abl\u00f6sefrei gekommen vom FC Schalke hat sich sehr positiv entwickelt auf aber auch neben dem Platz mit seinem sozialen Engagement Oder auch Philippe Coutinho Lucas Hernandez und Benjamin Pavard alles Spieler mit Qualit\u00e4t An der S\u00e4bener Stra\u00dfe hoffen sie auf baldige Ruhe Am Montag noch war deutlich Missstimmung gegen Neuer herauszuh\u00f6ren vom Interview erfuhren die Bayern noch vor der Ver\u00f6ffentlichung \u2013 aber erst nachdem es gef\u00fchrt war Nun gl\u00e4tten sich die Wogen wieder Karl Heinz Rummenigge signalisierte eine baldige Einigung m\u00f6glich dass noch in dieser Woche ein neuer Vertrag mit Neuer vermeldet wird Besch\u00e4digt geht Salihamidzic dennoch aus der Sache hervor Im Schatten von Kahn Und wie geht es mit ihm weiter Beim FC Bayern gibt es viele Kr\u00e4fte Spieler sind m\u00e4chtig Funktion\u00e4re auch Die n\u00e4chsten Monate k\u00f6nnten dar\u00fcber entscheiden wie und wo sich der Sportdirektor langfristig im neuen Machtgef\u00fcge des FC Bayern etabliert Ob er seine eigene Rolle findet oder zwischen den Kr\u00e4ften zerrieben wird Ab Sommer ist er nach seiner Bef\u00f6rderung auch Mitglied des Vorstands wie auch Oliver Kahn Kahn wird Rummenigge als Vorstandsvorsitzender beerben und der fr\u00fchere Torwart des Vereins gilt auch noch heute in der Rolle des Funktion\u00e4rs als durchaus beliebt bei den Anh\u00e4ngern Vielleicht w\u00e4re es f\u00fcr Salihamidzic besser sich abzugrenzen sich selbst zu positionieren seine eigenen St\u00e4rken auszuspielen einen eigenen Weg zu gehen Im Hintergrund zu agieren zu ackern Es w\u00e4re eine Rollenverteilung wie fr\u00fcher auf dem Platz wo Kahn der King war und Salihamidzic der K\u00e4mpfer",

concern for the U S military because of its implications for the regime s plans to develop long range missiles Air Force Gen John Hyten said Wednesday The U S has long suspected that Iran s efforts to put satellites into orbit are a cover for development of an intercontinental ballistic missile and those suspicions were reinforced by Iran s launch Tuesday of what it called a Noor or Light satellite into low Earth orbit powered by a three stage rocket We watch every rocket and missile that comes off the face of the Earth and we track it and characterize it very precisely Hyten the former head of U S Strategic Command said at a Pentagon briefing Related President Trump Orders Navy to Destroy Iranian Boats that Harass US Vessels We did that with the most recent Iranian launch I won t tell you exactly what the intelligence says about the rocket but what I can tell you is it went a very long way Hyten said And if you have a missile that goes a very long way whether it works or not or puts a satellite in space or not it went a very long way The apparent advancement in long range missile technology suggests that Iran has the ability to threaten our neighbors and allies and we want to make sure they can never threaten the United States he said Hyten said it is unclear whether the satellite had achieved orbit and is in working order but Iranian state TV showed the launch and said that ground bases were receiving signals from the satellite circling Earth every minutes The launch was the first by Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or IRGC to put a satellite into orbit according to Iran s Tasnim news agency Today the world s powerful armies do not have a comprehensive defense plan without being in space and achieving this superior technology that takes us into space and expands the realm of our abilities is a strategic achievement said Gen Hossein Salami head of the IRGC Tasnim reported Salami succeeded Qasem Soleimani who was killed in a Jan U S drone strike at Baghdad s international airport The IRGC operates its own military apart from Iran s regular armed forces and is answerable only to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini Secretary of State Mike Pompeo charged that the Iranian satellite launch was in violation of a United Nations Security Council resolution intended to limit Iran s ballistic missile development Every nation has an obligation to go to the United Nations and evaluate whether this missile launch was consistent with that Security Council resolution Pompeo told State Department reporters I don t think it remotely is and I think Iran

makes it possible to predict where vanished suspects will remerge and what escape routes they\u2019ll likely use if they sense they\u2019re about to be collared and cuffed \u201cTactical tracking is a high level skill set that allows military personnel or law enforcers to gather visual indications of a suspect\u2019s recent presence in or movement through an area and then correctly interpret what those indicators reveal \u201d UF PRO said UF PRO said each installment of \u201cPro\u2019s Guide to Tactical Tracking\u201d will be made available one week apart The announced approximate release

behind it and shows why it\u2019s the ideal choice in this situation In the concluding episode Part Vos shares tricks that can be used when suspects seek to disappear inside an urban area as does the gang he and his team have been chasing The most important of these presented techniques is known as the \u201ctrack trap\u201d\u2014useful for knowing through which intersections suspects pass as they flee along paved roads Vos is a former Royal Netherlands Marine qualified to teach sniping and jungle warfare in addition to combat tracking His skills as a combat tracking instructor were acquired

Manufacturing Development EMD phase including flight tests at a faster pace according to a service news release Related Head of Global Strike Command Wants to Make Air Force Bombers Even More Lethal While officials didn t call the latest decision a down select between the two companies a move that wasn t expected until fiscal the service said it came to the choice after an extensive evaluation of both companies contractor programmatic and technical approach This is not a down select per se said Elizabeth Thorn the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center s LRSO system program manager in the release Instead we are reframing our relationship with Lockheed Martin to focus on specific technology maturation we believe either has future applicability for the final LRSO design or will reduce overall program risk In the service awarded contracts to Lockheed and Raytheon to begin preliminary work on LRSO The agreements were valued at million each and were to last almost five years to mature design concepts and prove developmental technologies the Air Force said at the time The LRSO program will replace the 1980s era AGM 86B Air Launched Cruise Missile known as ALCM providing an air launched capability as part of the nuclear triad This early off ramp of a contractor is completely in line with the existing LRSO acquisition strategy which included periodic reviews to assess contractor designs said Maj Gen Shaun Morris Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center commander and program executive officer for strategic systems Lockheed Martin has been an excellent contractor and partner throughout the TMRR effort and this pivot to Raytheon does not represent a lack of effort or commitment on their part Lockheed Martin has supported the nuclear enterprise for decades and we continue to value their expertise in sensors and nuclear certification and surety he said Lockheed said in a statement that it is working with the program office and the Air Force to close out its work in the TMRR phase though it will still be involved to support the LRSO mission as Thorn explained We ve supported our nation s nuclear triad for more than years and look forward to working with the Air Force to support the LRSO mission specifically leveraging our sensor technology and nuclear certification and surety expertise the company said Despite the announcement a formal contract award for the next phase won t occur until fiscal as previously planned Raytheon added The LRSO is planned for the B as well as the B Spirit and the future B Long Range Strike Bomber Earlier this month Gen Timothy Ray head of Air Force Global Strike Command told Air Force Magazine that a conventional version of the LRSO is also a plausible fit for the B 1B Lancer though the aircraft is not slated to receive the weapon because it is no longer a nuclear capable bomber While there s no requirement to create a conventional version of LRSO Ray said it s the range he s interested in I think that s going to be a very very good missile he told the magazine Oriana Pawlyk can be reached at oriana pawlyk military com Follow her on Twitter at oriana0214 Read More These Are the Travel Exemptions in the Pentagon s

Internet providers offering temporarily free service to low income households during the pandemic But a big restriction on Verizon s offer makes it impossible for many people to get the deal The Verizon problem is one of several that s been pointed out by advocates for poor people at the nonprofit National Digital Inclusion Alliance NDIA Charter CenturyLink and Frontier have also been labeled disappointments even as Comcast earned praise The NDIA is maintaining a list of pandemic related telecom offers A similar group called EveryoneOn offers a search tool to find low income offers by ZIP code Verizon on March said it would provide two months of free home Internet and phone service for current low income subscribers in the Lifeline program and monthly discounts for new low income subscribers The discount lowers the starting price for 200Mbps Internet to a month But the broadband offers are available only on Verizon s fiber to the home FiOS service and not in DSL areas where Verizon never upgraded homes from copper to fiber When contacted by Ars Verizon said our DSL service does not meet the Lifeline program qualification standard referring to the 10Mbps to 20Mbps speed standards imposed by the FCC s Lifeline program which reimburses ISPs for discounts provided to low income people But while the days of free service applies to existing Lifeline customers the discounts for new FiOS customers apparently apply to low income subscribers even if they re not officially using Lifeline plans We do appreciate that Verizon has a discount offer NDIA Executive Director Angela Siefer told Ars The discount offer is using Lifeline to verify eligibility but Verizon has confirmed with us that it is not Lifeline so why limit where the discount is available Plus Lifeline s qualification standards allow for service to be provided at less than the speed standard if that is all that is available By not including DSL their most vulnerable customers are being left out of a valuable resource This includes the low income communities in underserved cities such as Buffalo and Baltimore Verizon would probably rather not add more customers to its outdated DSL network But the telco doesn t upgrade areas to fiber when it determines the potential profits aren t worth the investment leaving people in DSL areas in a precarious situation By limiting its two free months offer to current Lifeline subscribers Verizon is preventing poor people who didn t previously sign up for service from getting free broadband during the pandemic That s in contrast to other ISPs that are giving free service to low income subscribers who sign up now in recognition of the pandemic s impact on poor people who didn t already have broadband at home because they couldn t afford it Verizon s two free months offer is only available to customers who had a Verizon Lifeline plan as of March It isn t just a few big ISPs making better offers A North Dakota based cooperative called BEK Communications is giving four free months of fiber service to new subscribers for example About percent of US adults have broadband at home a Pew Research Center report says Racial minorities older adults rural residents and those with lower levels of education and income are less likely to have broadband service at home Pew says Low income access varies greatly by region Verizon is among hundreds of ISPs that signed the Federal Communications Commission s Keeping Americans Connected pledge meaning they promised to waive late fees to not terminate service when customers miss payments due to the coronavirus pandemic and to open Wi Fi hotspots to the public But the pledge is voluntary and the FCC s hands off approach to telecom regulation leaves the broadband industry in charge of whether to give low income people access during the pandemic Aside from that pledge and pre existing programs for low income subscribers such as Lifeline some major ISPs haven t made any pandemic specific offers to poor people ISPs with no pandemic specific offers of free or discounted service for poor people include CenturyLink Frontier and Cincinnati Bell Offers to hook up poor people during the pandemic thus vary greatly by region depending on which ISP is dominant locally We ve looked at this every which way We don t see any alternative to a federal broadband subsidy during the health crisis Siefer said Setting aside all the ways that Internet keeps a household functioning during this health crisis if people do not have Internet they will certainly not stay in their homes The digital divide is now a public safety issue Advocacy group Free Press urged ISPs to waive all billing for low income households seniors furloughed workers and households with public school students who have been sent home due to school closures When contacted by Ars Frontier pointed to its pre existing low income programs such as Lifeline and said it is working on a case by case basis with small businesses that may have been impacted or forced to close school districts and rural healthcare facilities that may require additional bandwidth and will continue evaluating options to assist customers through this difficult period CenturyLink also pointed to its pre existing low income programs and said it is suspending data usage limits for residential customers due to COVID That s not actually a major change\u2014while CenturyLink technically imposed a 1TB monthly limit it didn t charge overage fees When asked why it isn t making special pandemic related offers to low income people Cincinnati Bell told Ars that it will not attempt to proactively build market share through special promotions that are aimed at our competitors and that consequently necessitate foot traffic from our field technicians However the company told us that it has reconnected customer accounts that were previously suspended because of late payments Siefer said Cincinnati Bell s choice to avoid new customer signups is shortsighted community members in Cincinnati Bell territory who can t bank pay bills or shop at home must go out to stores ATMs payment centers and mailboxes People who need medical care but can t use telehealth tools are far more likely to show up at badly stressed emergency rooms and clinics or else go without care\u2014which could be a deadly choice in this situation Windstream is offering two free months to new Lifeline customers Comcast does \u201ctremendous job\u201d AT T\u2014which has a similar mix of fiber and DSL offerings as Verizon CenturyLink Frontier and Cincinnati Bell\u2014has done more to help poor people through the public health emergency that has caused millions of job losses and a huge increase in people working at home AT T is offering two free months of home Internet service to customers who order its low income plan by April After the free two months prices are a month for download speeds of 3Mbps or less and a month for speeds up to 10Mbps AT T said it is also expanding eligibility to cover more low income households and waiving data overage fees Other than the AT T plan having slow speeds and not allowing those with bad debt to be eligible we do not have complaints Siefer told us If a household has outstanding debt with AT T for fixed Internet service within the last six months they are ineligible Comcast of all companies is doing a tremendous job Siefer said Comcast made its per month Internet Essentials plan free to new low income customers for two months and raised speeds from 15Mbps download 2Mbps upload to 25Mbps 3Mbps Comcast is also temporarily accepting low income people into Internet Essentials even if they have outstanding debt owed to Comcast Comcast also temporarily waived data caps Problems in Charter territory Charter the second biggest Internet provider in the United States after Comcast is giving new customers with children in school free Internet access for days But the company faced criticism from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for not letting customers with unpaid bills take advantage of the free service during the pandemic Charter partially relented saying it would make the free offer available to New York customers with outstanding balances But the unpaid bills restriction is apparently still in place in the other states where Charter offers service In a blog post the NDIA listed several other shortcomings in Charter s approach One problem is that customers who get the two free months offer are not enrolled into a low income plan after the two months are up even if they are eligible Charter sells a Spectrum Internet Assist program to low income people for a month but apparently it isn t making this option easily available to people taking advantage of the free two months offer We are hearing repeatedly that people who try to sign up for the free two months are being told they will be charged for service after the free two months as if it were a promotional offer not a crisis offer Siefer said Charter could have set it up so that those households were transitioned to Spectrum Internet Assist Because of this it may be better in the long run for people to sign up for Internet Assist from the start instead of taking Charter s free two months offer The NDIA also urged Charter to expand eligibility of Internet Assist to more low income households similar to Comcast Internet Essentials and to Increase capacity to take phone calls requesting the free service or institute a call back system Shortly after the offer was first made last month the NDIA said it was hearing stories of four hour long waits on hold When contacted by Ars a Charter spokesperson noted that Eligibility for Charter s day free offer is not limited to households eligible for Spectrum Internet Assist or even low income households generally\u2014it is families with children in school K or college and professional educators throughout our state service area After the free two months are up new Internet customers with our regular Internet service would receive a discounted promotional price for the next months Charter said Disclosure The Advance Newhouse Partnership

resisting rips splits tears and other common forms of damage typically incurred during missions or operations \u201d said Armin Wagner head of UF PRO product development \u201cFor example a wearer

stitching is scant \u201d Despite the enhanced toughness Striker X Combat Pants are exceptionally comfortable and do not restrict the wearer\u2019s freedom of movement Wagner indicated \u201cThese new combat pants are fitted to the anatomic form and function of the lower body so they feel great and perform fantastically \u201d he said \u201cThe pants move as the wearer moves whether standing sitting kneeling laying walking running climbing or jumping This is possible because of our decision to include stretch panels made from Schoeller\u00ae Dynamic polyamide elastane blend stretch materials and to strategically position them in the most beneficial places \u201d Other important features of the debuting Striker X Combat Pants include \u2022 Ergonomic triple layer knee protection system that adjusts from the rear to provide extra cushioning or impact protection when needed \u2022 No melt no drip construction throughout \u2022 Nearly a dozen pockets of various sizes to allow

piece of tactical gear \u201d Wagner offered \u201cThese pants are designed with the needs of military units in mind They need combat pants that can go out on a mission and come back home in one piece or easily repair them out in the field if needed We know this because they told us this is what they need And we listened \u201cThe result is a model of combat pants that supplies maximum durability plus go anywhere do anything capability in environments of every imaginable type These pants embody functionality comfort usability and protectiveness \u201cWe are very confident that our Striker X

credit Despite a tsunami of new claims \u2013 4m and counting \u2013 and the loss of a fifth of staff due to self isolation the much maligned benefit has held up under the challenge of coronavirus The system hasn\u2019t crashed and thanks to the rapid redeployment of tens of thousands of officials from their usual roles to full time claims processing the \u201cpandemic\u201d cohort of new claimants is expected to receive their first benefit payments on time this week The director general of universal credit Neil Couling has been in confident mood going as far as to call a Zoom enabled press briefing last week to praise his hardworking staff and lay bets that despite the unprecedented economic chaos of the past few weeks universal credit would be more timely and efficient than ever \u201cThe system has run beautifully throughout the crisis \u201d he claimed not a phrase too often associated with the often hapless benefit A welfare system that is still largely fighting the ideological battles of five years ago is no longer fit for purpose Part of the reason the UK\u2019s social security system has managed to deliver its immediate overriding priority \u2013 to get emergency cash as swiftly as it can to millions left jobless overnight \u2013 is because by and large it has stopped doing almost everything else The vast architecture of conditionality from job search interviews to sanctions to fit for work tests has been put aside for at least three months making the system unexpectedly lean It will be interesting to see what the new claimant cohort makes of it the work and pensions select committee is conducting an inquiry in some ways forcibly changed by Covid it is on the face of it both more generous by \u00a3 a week and less punitive than it was even a month ago In important respects however universal credit and the wider benefit system remain frustratingly unreformed The UK is moving into what looks like a lengthy economic downturn and already there are signs that low income families are struggling The Food Foundation thinktank estimates that levels of food insecurity have quadrupled under lockdown with disabled people and families with children likely to be disproportionately affected Food banks have reported huge increases in demand There are reports of energy poverty of families making \u201cheat or eat\u201d choices If the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s predicted recession comes to pass the Department for Work and Pensions DWP will need to be bigger after staff cuts since it has already announced plans to hire new staff But more importantly it must recognise that a welfare system still largely fighting the ideological battles of five years ago is no longer fit for purpose The tabloid Westminster world of job shy shirkers and their equally mythical counterpoint those \u201chardworking families\u201d who would never need to rely on benefits seems a long way off And yet the social safety net feels more stuck complacent and unresponsive than ever That new universal credit claimants must wait a minimum five weeks for a first benefit payment and were forced into debt to tide them over that stressful period always felt like an aggressively ideological policy in the new era it feels positively perverse The Labour party has called for such advance loans made over the past month more than of them to be written off At the very least there is a strong case for suspending the monthly deductions for those loans for a few months As food banks know well advance loan repayments make it much harder for households to recover from the financial shock of job loss It is inequitable too that people claiming employment and support allowance or jobseeker\u2019s allowance have not received the \u00a3 a week benefits uprating enjoyed by those on universal credit That anomaly should be rectified Uprating child benefit by \u00a3 per child per week would says the Child Poverty Action Group cut poverty by Mitigating poverty Labour says must be a major part of the post Covid welfare policy response There are plenty of things the government could do to ease the impact on the poorest people not least by overhauling a welfare system scarred by always nasty and now painfully outdated policies So scrap the two child benefit limit with its poverty fuelling detachment of benefit levels from family need do away with the benefit cap which punishes claimants for not getting a job even where they are not expected to work It also should review the rollout of the next phase of universal credit to existing claimants from December a process so fraught that the Salvation Army warned just two months ago that unreformed it would \u201csteamroll vulnerable people into poverty\u201d Universal credit appears to have survived the initial crisis of lockdown intact because the DWP realised quickly enough that business as usual would not have worked in a crisis of this magnitude Times have changed Old habits die hard But there is no going back to the old ways Generosity fairness and ease of access must be the new watchwords", "page_url":

according to Iranian state media Iranian officials did not release any advance notice of the launch which occurred from the Shahroud missile range in the northeastern part of the country Videos

Washington and Tehran over the regime s missile programs The satellite dubbed Noor was sent into orbit using a long range rocket according to an April statement by Iran s Revolutionary Guard U S

sanctions on Iran that crippled its economy and cut its oil exports roughly in half In exchange for sanctions relief Iran accepted limits on its nuclear program and allowed international inspectors

tentative because the governor or mayor must first approve the plan Mayors and governors are coordinating their plans with USACE he said They are the final decision makers about the location of the facility A site assessment he said entails USACE looking at all kinds of facilities from small buildings like hotels and college dormitories to larger sites like field houses and convention centers The engineers are assessing sites that can apply to either COVID or non COVID patients he said As site assessments continue the engineers have been extremely innovative and have shared lessons learned which are being applied to what is called the standard model for site assessments he said As work continues the standard model gets refined he added noting that that model has been vetted through the Federal Emergency Management Agency which has the lead on this entire effort as well as the Department of Health and Human Services The goal behind the standard design model Semonite said is to more quickly deliver capability to the medical workers In planning for construction USACE is using modeling data which shows state and local projections for when peak capacity is needed on a particular date he said USACE also knows how many beds are available and how many new beds may be required at peak demand Not all facilities must be built by the Corps of Engineers USACE is also sharing its

University The Food and Drug Administration FDA has granted emergency use authorization EUA to Rutgers\u2019 RUCDR Infinite Biologics and its collaborators for a new collection approach that utilizes saliva as the primary test biomaterial for the SARS CoV coronavirus the first such approval granted by the federal agency The new saliva collection method which RUCDR developed in partnership with Spectrum Solutions and Accurate Diagnostic Labs ADL will allow for broader population screening than the current method of nose and throat swabs \u201cThe impact of this approval is significant \u201d said Andrew Brooks chief operating officer and director of technology development at RUCDR who also is a professor in the School of Arts and Sciences Department of Genetics at Rutgers University\u2013New Brunswick \u201cIt means we no longer have to put health care professionals at risk for infection by performing nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal collections We can preserve precious personal protective equipment for use in patient care instead of testing We can significantly increase the number of people tested each and every day as self collection of saliva is more quick and scalable than swab collections All of this combined will have a tremendous impact on testing in New Jersey and across the United States \u201d Soon after the Rutgers ADL team received notification from the FDA on Saturday the White House\u2019s COVID testing task force called Brooks to offer congratulations and support and to ask about any specific hurdles to expanding testing and enabling other laboratories to benefit from the accomplishment Shortly after the White House call the research team was contacted by chief executive officers of some of the world\u2019s largest life sciences companies that are involved in COVID testing \u201cI have spoken with these companies\u2019 leadership to not only share knowledge but to create opportunities for continuing to help innovate during this crisis \u201d Brooks said \u201cWe will work closely with these new partners the FDA and the White House task force to leverage everything Rutgers has to offer to not only help our community but also make a global impact \u201d Rutgers University President Robert Barchi called the new saliva test a \u201cherculean effort that is great for the country and the world and by reflection great for our university \u201d \u201cSaliva testing will help with the global shortage of swabs for sampling and increase testing of patients and it will not require health care professionals to be put at risk to collect samples \u201d Brooks said \u201cSaliva testing will also be important for people who are in quarantine because they don\u2019t know how long it will be until they are no longer infectious This will allow health care workers to release themselves from quarantine and safely come back to work \u201d \u201cThe test can help hospital based and private physicians to accurately assess the infection status of more patients with RUCDR Infinite Biologics doing the analysis \u201d said Jay A Tischfield the founder chief executive officer and scientific director of RUCDR and a Distinguished Professor also in the Department of Genetics at Rutgers\u2013New Brunswick and at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School \u201cRutgers is proud to be on the cutting edge of the fight against the COVID pandemic \u201d said Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences Chancellor Brian Strom \u201cWe have long said our researchers and health care employees are working to help make the world well but never has it been more true than now \u201d Rutgers University\u2013New Brunswick Chancellor Chris Molloy agrees \u201cRutgers has always been on the leading edge of research and discovery We are proud of the work we do and the positive impact it has on the world \u201d The FDA\u2019s approval of the new saliva testing approach is the second major announcement in recent days from RUCDR which launched a genetic testing service for the coronavirus that can test thousands of samples daily With the new saliva test that number may increase to tens of thousands of samples daily The tests are available to the RWJBarnabas Health network which has partnered with Rutgers University and is New Jersey\u2019s most comprehensive health care system including Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital University Hospital in Newark and many other facilities including several county health departments Starting Wednesday Rutgers in partnership with the Middlesex County government and RWJBarnabas

had a considerable impact on UK exports to the kingdom in the second half of last year And the figures do not include open licences which allow the export of an unlimited number of consignments over a fixed period typically between three and five years In the Observer revealed that for the previous five years the UK had been selling missiles and bombs to the Saudis under the open licence system

economic cost of staging games behind closed doors are coming to a head with a growing number of club owners especially in League One and League Two prepared to call off the season The biggest problem for League One and League Two clubs would be that there is next to no money for them to make from broadcasters behind closed doors and they would lose money if they stage such matches Restarting the season would also force clubs who have furloughed players to start paying them again Although the official approach from the EFL remains to wait for government guidance there is a broad acknowledgement that time is running out The DCMS and Public Health England are to meet representatives of sporting bodies on Friday to discuss a way forward but no firm guidance is expected and the EFL will not have a representative at the meeting Any update on the government\u2019s social distancing measures is not expected before May On Wednesday league officials briefed the EFL board over a number of possible scenarios on how the season could be salvaged and all required huge numbers of tests possibly into the hundreds of thousands Another meeting between Football League clubs is understood to have featured interventions from a number of owners sceptical of playing on The chairman of Stevenage Phil Wallace articulated concerns that are understood to be shared by many lower league clubs \u201cThe subject of testing at League One and League Two levels and the measures that would be necessary not to expose players and their families to the virus by putting people together in a contact sport environment are hard to overcome whilst social isolation is in play \u201d Wallace whose club are bottom of League Two said \u201cEven if we managed to find ways would all players accept the risk And if one person caught it then does the whole league have to stop It\u2019s hard to see a way to apply the \u2018when safe to do so\u2019 mantra of the EFL to the circumstances we have now \u201d Another long standing concern over extending player contracts has also become an immediate priority With as many as Football League players due to be out of contract at the end of June some clubs will be able to offer only the standard severance payment of a month\u2019s wages if matches are staged after that point Some clubs have indicated that severance payments will be beyond them in all circumstances The PFA has mandated players to conduct a ballot over whether to accept such terms or refuse to play The Fiver sign up and get our daily football email It is understood that many lower league players are braced for the season to be cancelled Clubs are not convinced that it is possible to finish the season before the end of June and a concern for players is that owners will not want to spend money on short term deals even if the campaign does continue beyond that date Another concern for clubs will be the legal implications of a player falling ill after playing football Players are also worried about infecting vulnerable relatives and it is understood that some Championship doctors have voiced concerns over whether it is safe for football to resume If the

State Medical University received a message from the university\u2019s administration Starting Friday the text read all students in their fourth year or higher would be deployed to coronavirus hospitals around Moscow Tatiana who asked that her last name be withheld is one of hundreds of medical students already volunteering or working in the Russian capital\u2019s coronavirus hospitals as The Moscow Times reported earlier this month But up until this week those students had joined the fight against the pandemic of their own accord even as officials rallied them to take to the frontlines Now Russia has moved to draft a broader swath of the country\u2019s medical students As coronavirus cases topped nationwide in a record single day increase Thursday and President Vladimir Putin earlier this week warned that the country has yet to reach the peak of its outbreak the deployment shows the strain the coronavirus is putting on Russia\u2019s healthcare system Even before the pandemic hit Russia doctors had complained about a lack of resources The fight has already taken its toll This week nurses quit en masse from Kommunarka Moscow\u2019s top coronavirus hospital over poor working conditions and low wages while doctors began listing colleagues who have died while treating patients nationwide They have counted so far To help shore up the frontlines the authorities have turned to the country\u2019s medical schools In a joint order signed Monday Russia\u2019s health and education ministries instructed universities to deploy third year or higher general practice pediatrics preventative medicine and dentistry students as well as nurses who have completed two years of study to coronavirus hospitals for \u201cpractical training \u201d Medical students in Russia start as early as meaning nursing students can begin working in coronavirus hospitals as young as and other students as young as Students study for up to seven years completing their practical training during summer breaks Russia\u2019s medical schools are fulfilling the government order with a heavy hand In the message to students seen by The Moscow Times the First Moscow State Medical University administration explained that refusal will result in unfulfilled academic requirements \u2014 which two students explained could be used as a basis for withdrawing scholarship money A student trade union committee for North Western State Medical University in St Petersburg put what\u2019s at stake bluntly \u201cYou can always refuse to work with Covid patients but this automatically equates to refusing to undergo practical training which carries disciplinary penalties \u201d the committee\u2019s administrators wrote on the group\u2019s Vkontakte page Medical students told The Moscow Times that information on the plan has arrived piecemeal and in a hurry with many details unclear Students first got wind of the plan last Friday when Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin who is heading Russia\u2019s coronavirus task force told the country\u2019s education and health ministries to draw up the order by Monday He said the plan would affect fourth and fifth year students \u201cClearly we will need additional personnel to cover all this work \u201d Sobyanin said during a task force meeting \u201cThere is no available personnel and pulling from one region to another is pointless \u201d \u201cThese are motivated guys who already have enough good knowledge and have chosen this profession \u201d he added \u201cThey will once more in practice see what is real medicine \u201d With the rumor mill churning over the weekend it was only when the joint order was published Monday that students learned the draft would be broader As the week went on they began hearing from their universities Students say their administrators have told them they will be paid if they work in the \u201cred zone\u201d \u2014 where medical workers come into direct contact with coronavirus patients \u2014 but will receive no salary if they work in the \u201cgreen zone \u201d Most students in \u201cred zones\u201d are working as nurses On Wednesday Moscow\u2019s Health Department said that student medical workers would earn over rubles per month and be able to choose from a \u201cvariety of jobs \u201d One student\u2019s notes of a Wednesday video conference call with First Moscow State Medical University\u2019s vice rector Litvinova said students were promised \u201cno less than rubles per month \u201d Three other students at the university confirmed that figure Students said they were skeptical of being paid that much Tatiana who is working as a nurse at First Moscow State Medical University\u2019s Clinical Hospital no but still hasn\u2019t seen the terms of her contract pointed to the Kommunarka nurses quitting this week as a sign of empty words from officials \u201cThis figure is mostly likely just talk because even professional doctors don\u2019t make this much \u201d she said \u201cWe are a cheap option \u201d According to a recent government count the average wage for a nurse in Moscow is rubles though popular career finder websites cite an average of about rubles per month On Thursday morning students in a group chat for fifth through seventh year students seen by The Moscow Times said their contracts were for rubles per month \u2014 a third of the promised amount Earlier this month Putin promised billion rubles million toward monthly bonuses for healthcare staff He said that doctors treating coronavirus patients would receive an additional rubles per month while nurses ambulance medics and drivers would get from to rubles The Kommunarka nurses who quit this week however complained that they had not received the bonuses Andrei Konoval co chairman of the independent medical labor union Destviye \u2014 or Action \u2014 said he doesn\u2019t believe Moscow officials would tell students such a bald faced lie He said that in the rush of the moment hospitals might not know how to dole out the money earmarked for coronavirus medics \u201cIn this chaos right now nothing is clear \u201d he said Aside from salary concerns students who have been working in Moscow\u2019s coronavirus hospitals this month worried that their fellow students are effectively not being given a choice to opt out \u201cI understand it is difficult at the moment and hands are needed but those students who don\u2019t want to do it shouldn t be forced \u201d said Nikita a year old fifth year student at First Moscow State Medical University who works at Kommunarka \u201cEven the so called green zones are dangerous and you can easily catch the virus \u201d Alexander a year old sixth year student at Russian National Research Medical University likewise working at Kommunarka echoed the concern \u201cYou can still get sick there \u2014 while working for free \u201d he said \u201cMany of my friends are very scared \u201d In emailed comments to The Moscow Times First Moscow State Medical University\u2019s vice rector Litvinova said that the university s leadership believes that \u201cpractical training is an essential part\u201d of the educational program including the \u201cprevention diagnosis and treatment of the novel coronavirus \u201d She added that students working in \u201c red zones \u201d in

a century has left few without overstressed healthcare systems But while most European countries are only fast tracking recent graduates Russia appears to be digging deeper into its medical reserves in an effort to get all hands on deck Some Russian students told The Moscow Times they were eager to join the frontlines despite their concerns Katerina a year old fourth year student at Russian National Research Medical University is planning on taking up a role as a nurse at Kommunarka She said she is eager to help because she knows from friends working across Moscow\u2019s coronavirus hospitals that \u201cthey really are not coping \u201d \u201cWe knew where we would be going when we signed up for medical school \u201d she said \u201cThis is now the time to prove whether we really

support from the United States Turkey is looking to expand its military technology \u2013 especially its missile defense system and drone fleet to combat Syrian and Russian backed forces on its southern border Turkey and Russia reached a cease fire agreement on March to halt military activity in the northwestern Idlib region after ongoing tensions raised the possibility of direct conflict Despite maintaining a tenuous cease fire agreement with Russia in Idlib tensions in Syria continue to rise While neither side truly wants direct conflict the Syrian regime and opposition are generally unwilling to abide by the cease fire putting it in jeopardy In February prior to the cease fire being signed Turkey requested Patriot missiles be deployed at the Turkish border with Syria to prevent attacks from Russian backed Syrian regime forces The U S however refused because of Turkey\u2019s acquisition of a rival missile defense system the Russian S in July Additionally the U S establishing Patriots on the border would mean an increased U S presence in the Middle East which President Donald Trump has vowed to reduce One reason the acquisition of the S concerns the U S is that it has the potential to compromise its F stealth fighter After its purchase of the S Turkey was kicked out of the F program costing the U S half a billion dollars and further distancing the two countries According to a statement released by the White House \u201cThe F cannot coexist with a Russian intelligence collection platform that will be used to learn about its advanced capabilities \u201d The U S has threatened Turkey with sanctions over the S and Congress has called on Trump to impose them The acquisition of the S has also caused a rift between Turkey and other NATO members despite claims by Turkey that the S will not be integrated into NATO defense systems NATO claims it is concerned that the S may hinder interoperability among its forces The alliance is also likely concerned that Turkey and Russia are developing a closer relationship in addition to the danger that the S could pose to fellow NATO member Greece and its F program Turkey is hoping to leverage its membership in the alliance to gain NATO\u2019s support in Syria At Turkey\u2019s request NATO members convened on March after an airstrike in Idlib killed Turkish troops According to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg NATO members expressed \u201cfull solidarity\u201d with Turkey but did not agree to establish a no fly zone Ankara had requested NATO members are already wary of increasing involvement in Syria as they want to avoid direct conflict with Russia or worsening the conflict along the border between Ankara and Damascus According to sources NATO is likely looking to strengthen its existing reconnaissance missions and build on the Patriot missile defense system operated by Spain in Turkey\u2019s Adana province Spain deployed its Patriot missile defense system to Turkey in as part of a request for NATO assistance in protection against possible attacks from Syria However Turkey\u2019s S 400s make it unlikely that they would be able to gain support for building on the missile defense system Tensions from disagreements with PKK affiliated groups in Syria have also contributed to the growing gap between the U S and Turkey The U S has continued to support the SDF in Syria which they claim is separate from the PKK terrorist group Since its offensive began in October Turkey has targeted the internationally designated terrorist group and its affiliates in Syria The U S halted a secretive military intelligence cooperation program which started in that gave Turkey access to American drones to collect intelligence on the PKK The decision to suspend the program was reportedly made in response to tensions between the U S and Turkey over the SDF Turkey \u2013 recognizing the strategic payoff that the armed drone program afforded it in Syria \u2013 intends to acquire a number of drones in its ambitious military procurement plan As part of this plan the Turkish military intends to acquire Alpagu attack drones developed by Turkish company Savunma Teknolojileri M\u00fchendislik STM to combat terrorists in northern Syria Although relations between the U S and Turkey may be in disrepair there is still hope In a statement showing support for Turkey on March U S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the U S believes Russia was responsible for the deaths of Turkish military personnel in Syria and that the U S will consider providing additional aid to Turkey The U S also placed new sanctions on Syrian officials including Syrian Defense Minister Ali Ayoub further supporting Turkey and the Syrian opposition According to reports the U S extended an offer to sell Patriot missile defense systems and allow them to re enter the F program if they promised not to operate the S The S will reportedly become operational in April The offer indicates that Washington still has hopes for its relationship with Turkey however if the S is activated the relationship will be further imperiled Middle East defense researcher and a non resident fellow at the

pernicious that it survives factory resets a trait that makes the malware impossible to remove without taking unusual measures The analysis found that the unusual persistence was the result of rogue folders containing a trojan installer neither of which was removed by a reset The trojan dropper would then reinstall the backdoor in the event of a reset Despite those insights the researcher still didn\u2019t know precisely how that happened Now a different researcher has filled in the missing pieces More about that later First a brief summary of xHelper A backdoor with superuser rights The malicious Android app poses as a performance enhancer that removes old and unneeded files Antivirus provider Malwarebytes has detected it on devices mainly located in the United States while AV from Russia based Kaspersky Lab found it on devices There s no evidence xHelper has ever been distributed through Google Play Once installed xHelper installs a backdoor that remotely installs apps downloaded from an attacker controlled server It also executes commands as a superuser a powerful privilege setting that gives the malware unfettered system rights Besides that the backdoor has access to sensitive data including browser cookies used to sign in to sites automatically Once the backdoor is installed the fake cleaner app disappears from the main screen and program menu and can only be viewed by inspecting the list of installed apps in the system settings February\u2019s post was penned by Malwarebytes researcher Nathan Collier He reported the ordeal one user had in ridding her phone of the malware Although the AV removed two xHelper variants and a related trojan from her device xHelper would reinfect the device within an hour xHelper came back even after she performed a factory reset Collier determined that the reinfections were the result of an undetectable file contained inside a hidden folder The folder was impossible to remove through normal means It remained unclear precisely how the folder got on infected phones Collier ruled out the possibility the folder and file came preinstalled on the device Also unclear was why the file was undetectable by AV and precisely how the malicious file was executed after the AV or a reboot removed the infection Triada Last week Kaspersky Lab researcher Igor Golovin published a post that filled in some of the gaps The reinfections he said were the result of files that were downloaded and installed by a notorious trojan known as Triada which ran once the xHelper app was installed Triada roots the devices and then uses its powerful system rights to install a series of malicious files directly into the system partition It does this by remounting the system partition in write mode To make the files even more persistent Triada gives them an immutable attribute which prevents deleting even by superusers Interestingly the attribute can be deleted using the chattr command A file named install recovery sh makes calls to files added to the system xbin folder That allows the malware to run each time the device is rebooted The result is what Golovin described as an \u201cunkillable\u201d infection that has extraordinary control over a device \u201cIt is very easy to get infected by xHelper \u201d Golovin told me \u201cDevices that are attacked by this malware could lack OS security fixes and stay vulnerable for rooting and installing this kind of malware Moreover it\u2019s very hard for users to remove this malware once it is installed This means the user base of xHelper can rapidly grow and xHelper can stay active on attacked devices for a long time \u201d Poisoning the well The researcher initially thought that it might be possible to remove xHelper by remounting the system partition in write mode to delete the malicious files stored there He eventually abandoned that theory \u201cTriada\u2019s creators also contemplated this question and duly applied another protection technique that involved modifying the system library system lib libc so \u201d Golovin explained \u201cThis library contains common code used by almost all executable files on the device Triada substitutes its own code for the mount function used to mount file systems in libc thereby preventing the user from mounting the system partition in write mode \u201d Fortunately the reinfection method divined in last week\u2019s report works only on devices running older Android versions with known rooting vulnerabilities Golovin however held out the possibility that in some cases xHelper may maintain persistence through malicious files that come preinstalled on phones or tablets People can disinfect devices by using their recovery mode when available to replace the infected libc so file with the legitimate one included with the original firmware Users can then either remove all malware from the system partition or simpler still reflash the device Golovin\u2019s analysis provides a valuable case study of a clever technique that may be used again should new rooting vulnerabilities be found in current versions of Android The insights could prove helpful both to end users who are comfortable using more advanced features of their phones as well as security professionals tasked with securing Android devices It\u2019s a \u201cvery good write up and I\u2019m glad someone was able to reproduce it more thoroughly than I could \u201d Collier said It \u201call seems feasible \u201d", "page_url": "https://arstechnica.com/?p=1668757", "label": 1, "score": "210705_news_157795"},

commander for patient services \u201cThe new system gives our other Army Health Clinics more options \u201d Bowden said \u201c It can process a testing sample in about an hour so it can be used to test patients with worsening symptoms to help the clinician rule out co infection with influenza which would affect how the patient is treated \u201d Bowden said LRMC will continue to process tests conventionally in batches when large numbers of people must be tested Since testing began military clinics in Europe have sent tests to host nation labs to LRMC or to the U S for processing \u201cThe in house testing capability cut what was a to day result process to a less than hour result \u201d Lt Col Shawn McFarland 48th Surgical Operations Squadron commander at RAF Lakenheath said last week

let me book a delivery as their system states that I am not a vulnerable customer According to its website my year old mother who lives on her own and has dementia is also not a vulnerable customer When I ring the helpline it is either engaged or there is a message and then I get cut off I really need help getting food delivered in the next weeks and don\u2019t seem to be able to even talk to any member of staff at Sainsbury\u2019s Please can someone help to get them to acknowledge my status AK Penzance Cornwall As a vulnerable woman aged with multiple disabilities I have been trying for a week now to inform Sainsbury\u2019s of my situation in order to get my regular online shopping given priority The website is useless and the telephone help centre is permanently engaged My disabilities include type diabetes osteoarthritis and asthma I have no help whatsoever and have been online grocery shopping for some time now On March I started trying to inform them of my situation At that stage each day I hung on for periods ranging from minutes to an hour and three quarters Finally on the Saturday I spoke to a man who assured me a form to fill in would be online on the Monday

you help MR Chelmsford Essex The coronavirus outbreak and government advice on self isolation and the need to stay at home has inevitably led to all supermarket delivery services which typically account for only of supermarket sales but which have since soared to struggling to meet demand We know retailers are buckling under the strain but what has not helped has been little clarity about the definition of who is deemed to be vulnerable The problem is that while you AK appear to be among the million most vulnerable identified by the government you still struggled to get your delivery Amazingly MR does not seem to qualify In addition to correspondence via this column from other readers unable to get their deliveries the Guardian\u2019s switchboard has been swamped with calls on the same problem We contacted Sainsbury\u2019s which agreed to escalate both your cases You have subsequently managed to book slots \u2013 and another for AK \u2019s mother \u2013 with we understand all three deliveries successfully made The retailer apologised to you both for the inconvenience caused by the long wait times and said \u201cWe are doing our absolute best to offer online delivery slots to elderly and vulnerable customers Elderly and vulnerable customers have priority over all slots We have proactively contacted customers who had already given us information that meant we could identify them as elderly or vulnerable Our customer careline is working at full capacity to help other vulnerable customers and we are able to give an additional customers a day access to delivery slots over the phone We have already booked in slots for elderly and vulnerable customers this week and this number is growing every day \u201cWe will shortly receive the government database which tells us which people the government considers to be most vulnerable Where these people are registered with us we will start to write to them next week to offer them a delivery slot \u201d It later added \u201cMR and AK have both been added to our vulnerable customer list and received priority delivery slots \u201d Sainsbury\u2019s is also prioritising elderly and vulnerable customers with its click and collect service which is also busy In response AK told us \u201cThank you so much for all your help which has given me the best possible result and has made my birthday a much happier day

message of peace and sharing \u201d \u201c\u2018Friends through sports\u2019 is no longer just a slogan but a common goal of military sports \u201d he added The Military World Games are held every four years the year preceding the Olympics and put on by the CISM and a host country The CISM has members and represents the world\u2019s second largest multi sport organization after the International Olympic Committee The inaugural games were held in Rome in and previous iterations have been held in Zagreb Croatia Catania Italy Hyderabad India Rio de Janeiro Brazil and Mungyeong South Korea A Winter edition of the games kicked off in and were last held in in Sochi Russia The games are held for military athletes to compete in dozens of sporting events like archery basketball parachuting sailing and swimming as well as select military sports such as the naval pentathlon The winter editions primarily include a variety of skiing events This past October at the Wuhan Games more than athletes from over countries competed in more than sports a record number of participants This year\u2019s games also presented a number of other firsts the first time the games were staged outside of military bases the first time the games were all held in the same city the first time an Athletes\u2019 Village was constructed the first time TV and VR systems were powered by 5G telecom technology and the first use of all round volunteer services for each delegation Enjoying this article Click here to subscribe for full access Just a month Despite these lauded firsts the games were not without controversy A Chinese team was suspended from its own games and their results voided in the middle distance orienteering competition for what was called \u201c extensive cheating \u201d Chinese athletes had placed first second and fourth in the women\u2019s competition and second in the men\u2019s race National teams from six European countries Austria Belgium France Poland Russia and Switzerland issued complaints to judges who discovered that local spectators had assisted the Chinese athletes The assistance included \u201cplacing markings and preparing special paths in terrain\u201d that only the Chinese competitors had knowledge of The incident likely displeased high level leadership Chinese media focused instead on its teams\u2019 victories including in the naval pentathlon Sports diplomacy seems to have become a preferred tool of China in its pursuit of improving its global standing and public diplomacy although its success is not guaranteed Beijing\u2019s hosting of the Summer Olympic Games in has often been referred to as China\u2019s coming out party drawing more than million tourists according to official statistics However there were ongoing limits on in country internet access and some protests at the time relating to Tibet Beijing will also host the Winter Games in China has also historically wielded sports exchanges to diffuse and transcend tension with the United States particularly with its high profile ping pong diplomacy Although China took home the top number of medals with in the Military World Games such events do not automatically translate to diplomatic success and public diplomacy gains Moreover these large scale events are not purely rooted in building confidence and promoting friendship and peace despite the public discourse China was able to showcase its infrastructure and technological prowess particularly as competition and controversy over 5G heats up And as much as China seeks to orchestrate its hosting it simultaneously invites opportunity for additional scrutiny and opens the potential for things running off script \u2013 with the middle distance orienteering debacle as exhibit A In the short term cheating on a public sporting stage may generate embarrasssment but over time China is likely to learn from these instances and adapt Military games of this variety may seem like mere shows

best protect the force Thomas said Some of those actions he said include limiting the movement of certain service members using staggered shifts telework and implementation of health protection

OneWeb a British satellite internet startup formerly valued at 3bn and also backed by Mr Son has filed for bankruptcy After the WeWork fiasco smart VC money turned more cautious particularly with regard to Vision Fund firms they went from garnering praise to seeming problematic Now investors customers and suppliers \u201cthink you must be a crappy company\u201d if you were backed by the fund says the boss of one who keeps assuring them \u201cwe are not the next WeWork\u201d A Vision Fund spokesperson says \u201cWe\u2019re sorry to hear it That has not been our experience with our other founders \u201d In fact the malaise extends well beyond Mr Son\u2019s empire In the last quarter of American venture backed firms raised less capital than in the previous quarter and big funding rounds\u2014over 100m\u2014fell by a third Last year China home to four of the world\u2019s ten most richly valued unicorns entered a \u201ccapital winter\u201d as investors turned against firms handing out huge subsidies to consumers in a reckless pursuit of customers Some Chinese unicorns went bust including Tuandaiwang a peer to peer lender once valued at 4bn The coronavirus shock comes at a time when most tech unicorns were already exhibiting underlying health problems Some most notoriously WeWork never really deserved the label in the first place Their businesses had at best a tenuous claim to techiness\u2014and so to the \u201cflywheel\u201d effect behind the likes of Amazon or Facebook in which a large user base makes them more attractive to more users and so on Other companies are bona fide technology firms but like Uber or Lyft find that digital flywheels gum up And too many unicorns rest on shaky and opaque financial structures that may exaggerate their lofty valuations Start with \u201cfake tech\u201d These include capital intensive firms such as WeWork where accommodating more customers means leasing more office space and direct to consumer retailers such as Casper which sells snazzy bedding \u201cWe consider ourselves a tech company first \u201d declared its co founder Neil Parikh in Stockmarket investors considered it a mattress retailer In February it listed at 575m less than half its 1bn private valuation Pie in the sky Zume recounts a VC investor close to it \u201conly used to talk about the robots never about the pizza\u201d When its lorries rounded corners melted mozzarella ran everywhere \u201cWhen we ordered a margherita \u201d the investor remembers \u201cit tasted bad \u201d Some proper tech unicorns nevertheless discovered that in the physical world where many at least partially reside flywheels encounter friction In theory their markets are almost limitless with nearly half of humanity carrying a smartphone Their business models like Uber\u2019s enjoy certain network effects demand from more riders in a given city lures more drivers to the platform more drivers in turn attract more riders by making rides easier and cheaper to hail And they can lower upfront costs by outsourcing things like accounting and data storage to the cloud The trouble is that in practice variable costs\u2014subsidies paid to drivers to generate business say\u2014rise with every new customer People \u201cthought software changes everything\u201d says Aaron Levie co founder of Box a listed enterprise cloud firm But in many cases the digital platform is only a small part of the cost structure \u201cThe physical assets stay expensive \u201d No network effects means lower barriers to entry for rivals The flywheel breaks down because riders have no reason to favour an Uber over a Lyft Most will go for whichever is cheaper\u2014which leads both firms to fight for customers with cut price rides subsidised by their VC backers\u2019 cash In the words of Marco Zappacosta co founder of Thumbtack a local services marketplace \u201cSome companies ended up selling for cents \u201d Randy Komisar of Kleiner Perkins a big VC firm offers an alternative rule of thumb For a unicorn to count as genuinely \u201ctech\u201d\u2014and therefore profitably scalable\u2014its actual product must be technology he says \u201cit can\u2019t just be using technology \u201d Businesses selling physical goods or services often don\u2019t make the cut Those providing cloud based services especially to corporations\u2014like Snowflake which helps firms warehouse data in the cloud or PagerDuty which assists companies\u2019 digital operations \u2014do It helps that like Slack and Zoom a video conferencing firm that also went public last year they are coronavirus proof Indeed lockdowns are boosting their business by pushing firms to move more functions online That is not to say that the consumer internet is dead Airbnb a home sharing website has seen bookings fall by in big European cities as the pandemic halted trips It may delay its IPO which was expected to be this year\u2019s biggest But despite racking up losses of late it is well managed cash rich and thanks to an unmatched global reach that puts up a high barrier to entry likely to make money again once people get back to travelling Neil Shen of Sequoia Capital China says that investors still believe in the ability of some Chinese firms especially 10bn plus \u201csuper unicorns\u201d to dominate their giant home market Meituan Dianping a food delivery firm and Pinduoduo an e commerce site were criticised for losing money ahead of their IPO s in Both ex unicorns have since taken off On March 30th Meituan even reported a quarterly profit though it warned of a coronavirus hit in the coming months One promising candidate to follow in their footsteps is ByteDance the parent company of TikTok a hit video sharing app\u2014and with a valuation of 75bn the world\u2019s biggest unicorn in which the Vision Fund also has a stake The complex and opaque financial practices behind the calculation of unicorns\u2019 valuations are the third pre existing condition that afflicts most of them\u2014including those which pass Mr Komisar\u2019s test boast solid business models and hold enough cash to tide them over a rough few months or more These conditions lead firms to overstate their value in two main ways The first has to do with ownership structure A private firm\u2019s headline valuation is the product of the number of shares and the price per share at the last funding round But shares issued in later rounds often have downside protections such as seniority over other investors and IPO return guarantees These lower the value of common equity issued in previous rounds In Ilya Strebulaev of the Stanford Graduate School of Business examined the legal terms of unicorns\u2019 various share classes and found that firms were overstating their valuations by on average The second issue is one of governance Recent years have seen frequent use of \u201cinside rounds\u201d in which existing backers stump up more money These can be a vote of confidence from people who know a business well But they are also a way for VC firms to mark up their portfolios generating higher internal rates of return that are more attractive to institutional investors and form the basis on which many partners get paid According to Mike Cagney co founder of three fintech unicorns SoFi Provenance and Figure an unwritten VC rule advises against a firm which led one investment round in a startup leading the next That inside rounds have become more common in recent years creates a credibility issue for Silicon Valley he says As a result of such finagling of the roughly American unicorns probably only half merit the moniker reckons one veteran founder Although the frequency of \u201cdown rounds\u201d in which valuations fall rather than rise does not yet appear to have increased activity in the opaque secondary market for unicorn shares suggests that a repricing is under way Sellers in such marketplaces chiefly company insiders and VC firms seeking an early exit appear to outnumber buyers in transactions involving such darlings as Grab a 14bn Singaporean ride hailing group and Didi Chuxing a Chinese rival Phil Haslett of EquityZen one such marketplace in New York revealed in March that shares in many big private startups were changing hands at roughly below their most recent funding round in part as rank and file employees lined up to cash in The trend has intensified as virus linked uncertainty pummels risky assets These ructions point to one certainty a shake out looms Firms that have most to lose from virus related measures are shedding workers Even before covid Lime laid off of its staff and exited a dozen cities On March 27th Bird a rival announced that it was sacking a third of its workers to conserve cash In all unicorns have trimmed their payrolls by several thousand people That is probably not the end of retrenchment Workers who remain are seeing the value of their shares dwindle and prospects of an IPO windfall recede Even viable listings are on ice until the markets\u2019 pandemic fever breaks In the meantime the unicorn world is astir with talk of consolidation SoftBank has reportedly long wanted DoorDash and Uber Eats to merge A tie up now looks appetising The Japanese firm may once again try to combine Grab and Gojek a rival in Indonesia where a price war is leading both to lose perhaps 200m a month In America Uber may try to woo Lyft whose share price has fallen faster than its own Not so tasty anymore Selling to strategic buyers offers another way out In February Intuit a financial software giant bought Credit Karma a personal finance portal for 7bn Many potential acquirers are however hoarding cash until the pandemic passes The uglies are coming If all else fails \u201csell it to one of the big uglies\u201d says one VC chief The \u201cuglies\u201d in question\u2014Apple Microsoft Alphabet Amazon and Facebook\u2014are collectively sitting on more than 570bn of gross cash In normal times regulators would balk at a takeover by one of the tech giants But these are not normal times As a painful recession looms preserving jobs\u2014including not just those of well paid coders but of the much larger army of gig economy workers\u2014may override antitrust concerns Even if some unicorns are spared\u2014through mergers acquisitions or just good fortune\u2014the coronavirus is certain to ravage the herd It will probably put the term itself which has come to denote excess and broken promises out to pasture A new word may be needed says Mr

minds of fans forever Others such as the \u201cworld title\u201d the club won in Florida a few months later are not so well remembered The game in Miami that August billed by some as the unofficial World Club Championship pitted Arsenal against Independiente the reigning champions of Argentina It gave Graham a rare opportunity to test himself against overseas opposition and the trip to the US proved popular with the players With temperatures constantly above \u00b0F and humidity soaring training in the lead up to the match was done and dusted by 30am giving Arsenal\u2019s players free rein for the rest of the day which did not always end well Perry Groves tells a tale of a round of golf on the West Palm Beach course that finished prematurely when he Martin Hayes Tony Adams and Paul

most of the match confronting each other with referee Ra\u00fal Dominguez quickly losing control It was little wonder that Graham later said \u201cThere were certain incidents that weren\u2019t good for football \u201d Dominguez showed seven yellow cards and sent off a player from each team He also banished Arsenal\u2019s physio Gary Lewin to the dressing room midway through the first half Lewin had tried to run on to the pitch to give the Arsenal players some water but Dominguez was having none of it The referee thought the physio had undermined his authority by trying to enter the field of play without permission so sent him off \u201cTo say it was a harsh decision is an understatement \u201d reflected Graham after the game With Lewin out of action Arsenal\u2019s assistant manager Theo Foley had to tend to the injured Lee Dixon towards the end of the first half The players involved By this point David Rocastle had already fired Arsenal in front Carlos Alfaro equalised for Independiente in the 69th minute and things took another turn for the worse for Arsenal when Gus Caesar was sent off shortly afterwards Their hopes seemed to be evaporating into the humid sky but that Arsenal team was made of stern stuff When Adams was brought down in the box by Pedro Monz\u00f3n \u2013 who received his marching orders \u2013 Rocastle stepped forward to score the penalty that gave Arsenal the prestigious ahem ZDS Challenge Trophy Match reports from the time suggest the contest was far from entertaining The Times concluded that the game was \u201cniggly almost unpleasant\u201d the Express reported on the \u201csinister cynicism\u201d of the Independiente defenders and the Mail called the fixture \u201cbad tempered\u201d In the Guardian David Lacey noted that the encounter was \u201ca relatively peaceful affair\u201d in comparison to previous clashes between teams from England and Argentina but that wasn\u2019t saying much Rocastle later spoke about the treatment he was subjected to during the supposedly friendly match \u201cI was kicked I was punched and the only abusive word they seemed to know was \u2018nigger\u2019 That didn\u2019t offend me and I don\u2019t mind

Cooperation - Carnegie Endowment for International Peace", "text": "Last January U S President Donald Trump reasserted his desire for NATO to be more involved in the Middle East Following previous calls from U S administrations for closer cooperation between NATO and Middle Eastern partners Trump\u2019s idea was a reminder that the U S did not intend to solely bear the cost of security assistance to the region NATO does have old and extensive military relations with local armed forces but given the limited results of that engagement Washington\u2019s expectations of a new division of labor are doomed to fail Competing political agendas among NATO members have hindered the implementation of any ambitious partnership in the region The U S and southern European countries such as Italy and Spain have long pushed for greater NATO involvement beyond the Mediterranean Sea In contrast other countries like France dismissed the organization as a military entity with no diplomatic experience to handle Middle Eastern predicaments Moreover Turkey under President Erdogan systematically tried to block NATO activities in the region that did not align with its own strategy such as NATO cooperation with Israel or Egypt Notwithstanding the political hurdles military relations between the transatlantic organization and local armed forces have endured and deepened in the last three decades With numerous training initiatives NATO\u2019s contribution to military reforms in the Middle East has been significant in terms of defense diplomacy specifically by enabling the international socialization of local armed forces However because of the political constraints in Brussels the U S administration should better calibrate its expectations NATO\u2019s involvement in the operational effectiveness of Arab militaries has been and will remain modest and does not contribute to their much needed modernization The two primary vehicles of NATO policies in the region are the Mediterranean Dialogue MD signed in with Israel and six Arab countries Mauritania Morocco Algeria Tunisia Egypt and Jordan and the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative ICI The ICI was finalized in and involves four Gulf monarchies the UAE Kuwait Qatar and Bahrain These partnerships were later revised to include a variety of activities ranging from diplomatic consultations to training activities In NATO began applying a new approach to its regional partnerships called \u201c projecting stability \u201d The concept emphasizes the need to stabilize areas of interest such as the Middle East by helping regional partners strengthening their military capabilities Since then \u201cprojecting stability\u201d has been the prevailing narrative for NATO Middle East engagement Military education and training are the cornerstone of NATO regional policy Middle Eastern partners participate in numerous programs including military exercises attendance to operational courses at the NATO School in Germany and strategic level courses at the NATO Defense College in Italy This last entity delivers a Regional Cooperation Course which has trained over officers from NATO and Middle Eastern militaries to date In NATO and Kuwait inaugurated the NATO Istanbul Cooperation Initiative Regional Centre calling it \u201c a new home for the Alliance in the Gulf \u201d This center which the Kuwaiti government hosts gathers NATO and Gulf officers through courses focused on security issues such as maritime security and energy infrastructure security or cybersecurity In the last three years the center delivered short term programs attended by about participants from GCC countries Finally in NATO resumed its training mission to the Iraqi armed forces The mission was originally launched in after the U S invasion and heavily relied on U S political support and military resources About Iraqi officers were trained until the program was disbanded following the U S withdrawal under President Obama though NATO continued to provide occasional training to Iraqi officials particularly in the field of crisis management exercises NATO training and education programs in the Middle East have primarily been successful in the field of defense diplomacy by creating new international networks of military leaders Over the last two decades these activities created processes and routines for officers on both sides to engage on a regular basis NATO played the role of an \u201cagent of socialization\u201d in the same way Alexandra Gheciu depicted NATO engagement in East Europe in the nineties The social proximity and the informal ties built through these programs allowed both sides to conduct close consultations between defense officials According to NATO decision makers this played a decisive role in the coordination of NATO forces with Qatari and Emirati counterparts when the latter joined the operation in Libya Furthermore as regional organizations in the Middle East like the Arab League or the Gulf Cooperation Council GCC have struggled to build joint military structures NATO programs help Arab officers better grasp the nature of multilateral defense work This enables them to enhance their interoperability NATO provided a standard to emulate for the GCC as the NATO Military Committee and the NATO Defense College were references used by the GCC to design its own joint command and its Gulf Defense Academy Beyond these achievements the success of the NATO military cooperation in the Middle East is proportional to its limited scope The NATO mission in Iraq relies on approximately advisors Yet its presence in Kuwait is even more modest two representatives from Brussels Headquarters are assigned to the center and most of the training activities are provided by \u201cmobile teams\u201d sent from various commands in Europe and the U S Admittedly last February the alliance and the Iraqi government announced their intent to add troops dedicated to the training mission but the coronavirus pandemic is jeopardizing this decision The pandemic disrupts military deployments in Europe as well as in Iraq where the military suspended all its training activities For the time being most NATO countries have withdrawn their troops and redeployed them to Kuwait while waiting for the end of the health crisis Given the unpredictable duration of the outbreak it is unclear when NATO could resume the mission and if its expansion would still follow More worryingly NATO assistance to the Middle East lacks a clear sense of purpose A high level Kuwaiti security official described it back in as \u201ca partnership without a cause The NATO bureaucracy is such that training initiatives are usually launched after a major decision taken in Brussels\u2014but policy follow up is limited if not absent During conversations with NATO officials they were unable to refer to specific measures of assessment and tended to use the mere existence of activities as a sign of success In the case of the Kuwait based center NATO representatives acknowledged an ongoing discussion on the establishment of assessment metrics Yet specifying performance indicators with local partners may challenge their governance of armed forces and therefore tends to be dismissed in Brussels as too politically sensitive Efforts inside the organization to build a comprehensive strategy that identifies desired outcomes and closely monitors the effectiveness of ongoing training activities in the Middle East are absent As a result the U S government should realign its objectives towards the Atlantic Alliance in the Middle East with the reality of NATO\u2019s regional engagement Given the limitations of NATO\u2019s military cooperation\u2014however small successes it has yielded\u2014and its security assistance it should not expect to decisively impact the military effectiveness of Middle Eastern partners But NATO has and can continue to make a difference on other issues by reinforcing multinational defense diplomacy helping Arab military forces identify best practices for joint planning and common training and education programs By emphasizing multilateral cooperation the alliance can strengthen the security architecture of the Middle East\u2014a worthy ultimate goal in the region Jean Loup Samaan is Associate Professor in

for courage displayed \u201cin the presence of the enemy\u201d Its long history is filled with true stories of great bravery But one long held belief \u2013 that Victoria Cross medals were made from enemy guns captured during the Crimean war against Russia \u2013 is unlikely to be true and originated instead from speculation in the press according to new research Instituted by Queen Victoria the Victoria Cross is Britain\u2019s highest award for valour in war and has been awarded times The Queen saw little to celebrate in victory at Sevastopol and displayed little interest in captured Russian ordnance Dr Andrew Marriott researcher Dr Andrew Marriott a retired lieutenant colonel and visiting researcher at Newcastle University has concluded that it is \u201chighly implausible\u201d that the medals came from Russian guns after the victory at the siege of Sevastapol in His research led him to a newspaper report at the time asserting that they did come from the captured guns He also found a letter in the Times from a Crimean veteran suggesting the same thing and so he says the myth was born Using x ray fluorescence scans to examine the composition of Victoria Cross medals from to the research showed that part way through the first world war and again during the second world war there were noticeable changes in composition when compared with the 19th century medals \u201cAlthough we know that Queen Victoria decreed that the new honour be cast from bronze there is no evidence to suggest that she wanted captured weapons from Sevastopol to be used for this purpose \u201d Marriott said \u201cLike many at the time the Queen saw little to celebrate from the victory at Sevastopol and had displayed little interest in the captured Russian ordnance The only contemporary record of a Sevastopol connection is a newspaper report of the medal ceremony in Hyde Park in The correspondent most likely conflated various stories circulating about the redistribution and recycling of captured Crimean guns \u201d The year old who spent years in the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers explained that Hancocks Jewellers in London has been the sole producer of the medal since its inception A Victoria Cross Photograph Edmund Terakopian PA But during the first world war Hancocks was forced to ask the War Office for a resupply of metal and believing the myth that had been created they turned to captured guns Marriott said \u201cHancocks were running out of metal so asked the War Office for a resupply and it\u2019s probable that staff in the War Office who were probably thinking about other things than the Victoria Cross looked at each other and asked where do you get this metal from By then there would have been a tradition about Sevastopol guns so a delegation would have been sent to cut off bits of guns to supply to Hancocks \u201d The current source of Victoria Cross metal is thought to be a cascabel \u2013 the round protrusion at the back of a cannon \u2013 stored at a Ministry of Defence depot in Donnington Shropshire Published in Post Medieval Archaeology the research found historical evidence that this cascabel may have been taken from a gun captured during the second Anglo Chinese war of three years after the first Victoria Cross awards were made \u201cWhile it\u2019s unlikely that even the earliest medals came from the ordnance captured at Sevastopol it is clear that most of the VCs awarded since the first world war have plausibly been sourced from the cascabels of captured guns \u2013 an important and symbolic fact for those who have received the honour in recognition of their bravery \u201d Marriott said The medal was awarded to recipients in the first world war and to in the second world war The most recent person to receive it was Joshua Leakey from the Parachute Regiment for his involvement in a raid in Helmand Province Afghanistan Notable recipients of the Victoria Cross Jack Cornwell was posthumously awarded the VC after he died aged following the Battle of Jutland in the first world war Sir Philip Neame who was awarded a Victoria Cross during fighting in France in the first world war would go on to win an Olympic gold medal in the Running Deer competition before serving again in the second world war Andrew Fitzgibbon was an Irish soldier and thought to be the youngest recipient after being awarded it aged during the third China war in

Union and Tehran In terms of imports China is already Armenia\u2019s second biggest partner after its strategic ally Russia The South Caucasus is not just important to China for economic reasons For some years now Beijing has been dealing with problems of radical jihadism in its Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region With its proximity to the Middle East the Caucasus region is important in the context of combating this threat Key figures in the Islamic State IS terrorist organization came from Georgia\u2019s Pankisi Gorge and according to the Soufan Group security intelligence service as of the end of people from Azerbaijan and Georgian nationals were involved with IS in the Middle East The South Caucasus nations have their own reasons for wanting to cooperate with China For Georgia and Azerbaijan which both have breakaway regions it is extremely important that China consistently stands up for the principles of territorial integrity China has no interest in interfering in issues relating to the integrity of other countries since it has its own problems with Taiwan Tibet and Xinjiang and would certainly not appreciate any foreign interference in them When visiting Tbilisi in May Wang said that China respected \u201cthe independence sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia \u201d which has long had no control over its two breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia In response the Transcaucasian leaders are also ready to demonstrate their solidarity with Beijing Azeri President Ilham Aliyev has said \u201cas far as the issue of Taiwan goes our country always stands for the position of a unified China That position will not change \u201d The situation is not entirely black and white however If Baku which has adopted a path of equal distance from the world centers of power can afford more room for maneuver in its relations with Beijing then Tbilisi\u2019s rapprochement with China is regularly the subject of criticism from the West Wang\u2019s visit to Georgia for example elicited ire in the United States The following month Georgia\u2019s then prime minister Mamuka Bakhtadze was given a dressing down in Washington by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo over Georgia\u2019s economic plans with China in which China and Russia were described as \u201cpretended friends who do not have Georgia\u2019s best interests at heart\u201d \u2014 though it is Georgia that despite its stated intent to join NATO and the EU remains the only state in the South Caucasus to have signed a free trade agreement with China Armenia has different aims where China is concerned Faced with a lack of regional integration and dependence on the dynamics of Russia Georgia relations since Armenia does not share a border with its ally Russia Yerevan is striving to broaden its international ties in all directions For all three countries China plays the role of an alternative to Russia and the West Tbilisi Yerevan and Baku are all tired of Moscow Washington and Brussels eternally squabbling on their own territory In this respect Beijing is seen as a possible counterbalance In the opinion of the countries of the South Caucasus ever since the West became engaged in a confrontation with Russia it has not been capable of objectively supporting territorial integrity in the region For the last two decades Russia and the West have by turns changed their commitment to the principles of status quo and revisionism support for national self determination and the unity of states China on the other hand has demonstrated consistency in its foreign policy regardless of what has happened in Kosovo Abkhazia and Crimea For small states the rules of the game in international relations are extremely important unlike for major powers which can afford to improvise In the South Caucasus this is resulting in pragmatic approaches to foreign policy \u2014 hence Georgia signing the free trade agreement with Beijing while being determined to join NATO It\u2019s early days to be talking about Beijing as the main player in the region According to Asia expert Stanislav Tarasov China is carrying out thorough \u201cdiplomatic reconnaissance in Transcaucasia\u201d based on its economic relations with the countries There is no chance of Beijing getting involved in the resolution of ethnopolitical conflicts From China\u2019s perspective \u201cRussia could play a positive role in the region because it traditionally has influence here So problems between Russia and Georgia must only be resolved by those two countries China will not interfere in their affairs \u201d At a time when demand for diversified foreign policy in the Caucasus is clear Beijing is building political frameworks that are attractive to countries in the region

according to a top Pentagon official We just issued a memo that directs contracting officers to support a U S Forces Afghanistan memo to redeploy at risk contractor employees due to insufficient medical capability in country said Ellen Lord the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment We project this number to be less than but we are committed to taking care of them she said at a Pentagon briefing Monday Related Air Force Uses Cutting Edge Isolation Pod to Evacuate COVID Patients from Afghanistan The nearly to be withdrawn would come from the more than U S citizens among the more than Defense Department contractors in Afghanistan according to a U S Central Command report in January Lord gave no timeline for the withdrawal and did not say how many contractors had tested positive for coronavirus or shown symptoms but the announcement follows the evacuation of three contractors from Afghanistan to Germany aboard an Air Force C Globemaster III specially outfitted to isolate infectious patients This marks the first operational use of the system that was developed for the Ebola crisis but was never used until now Lord said She said the evacuations are part of continuing efforts by the Pentagon s Joint Staff U S Transportation Command and the Air Force to ensure that we can safely transport COVID patients from overseas locations to the United States In addition We are absolutely committed to the safety of the air crew and medical support staff during these missions Lord said In a phone briefing from Brussels on April Air Force Gen Tod Wolters commander of NATO and U S European Command said the C with the three American contractors aboard landed at Ramstein Air Base Germany on April This was a first for our U S Department of Defense from Afghanistan to Europe Wolters said He did not give an update on the conditions of the three contractors but said they were taken to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center for treatment According to Lord the C carried a Transport Isolation System or TIS originally developed in to transport Ebola patients but never used The TIS is a tent like infectious disease containment enclosure that allows patients to be treated aboard the aircraft while protecting aircrew members from exposure according to Air Mobility Command AMC Before the evacuations from Afghanistan were announced the Air Force said in a release that AMC had developed a COVID Patient Movement Plan In coordination with U S Transportation Command we ve produced a detailed plan that guides our crews on how to safely and effectively move ill patients to a location where they can receive greater care all while providing protection for our aircrew medical personnel and aircraft Brig Gen Jimmy Canlas 618th Air Operations Center commander said in the Air Force release As reported by Military com last week the Air Force and AMC are also testing methods for the possible transport of dozens of COVID patients at a time aboard aircraft without using the TIS isolation tents The tests earlier in April by Air Mobility Command with researchers from the National Strategic Research Institute at the University of Nebraska and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency involved airflow experiments on six different aircraft The goal was to analyze how air travels through a cargo hold using specialized traceable droplets said Maj Dave Sustello AMC s Test and Evaluation Squadron operations officer In its latest coronavirus report Tuesday the DoD said there were a total of confirmed cases among service members civilians dependents and contractors worldwide The DoD does not give locations for the positive cases but said that were among contractors and of them were hospitalized The U S has not given an update on the number of coronavirus cases among U S and coalition troops in Afghanistan since March when the NATO Resolute Support mission said there were four cases without stating whether they were among U S or coalition troops Also on March Army Gen Austin Scott Miller commander of U S and NATO forces in Afghanistan issued a plea by Twitter and by teleconference with Afghan officials to the Afghan people to stop fighting and turn to combating the coronavirus All sides need to reduce violence so we can stay focused on preventing the spread of this virus Miller said According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center there were confirmed cases of coronavirus in Afghanistan as of midday Tuesday and deaths Afghanistan s Health Ministry reported the same figures Tuesday according to local Tolo News but the spread of the disease was difficult to determine in a nation with a precarious health care system lacking in basic equipment for testing and treatment There is no lab to analyze

of a series of profiles of notable spring graduates Nathan Callahan started out as an engineering student at Arizona State University but discovered the degree wasn\u2019t for him After a challenging first year Callahan was gearing up to join the Navy but when he received a New American University President\u2019s Scholarship he decided to change majors and take advantage of the opportunity to continue his education Nathan Callahan is graduating this semester with his bachelor s degree in history and a certificate in political history and leadership Photo courtesy of Nathan Callahan Download Full Image \u201cI decided I would turn to the other subject that had always interested me and switched into the history program \u201d said Callahan He found his stride as a history major and added a certificate in political history and leadership to his coursework In December Callahan was awarded an internship at the Goldwater Institute in downtown Phoenix where he worked with the communications department to help promote legislative initiatives and litigation cases Callahan is graduating this semester from the School of Historical Philosophical and Religious Studies and we caught up with him to ask him about his time at ASU Question What was your \u201caha\u201d moment when you realized you wanted to study the field you majored in Answer My aha moment didn t come until after my first semester as a sophomore I had switched into history over the summer and wasn t sure how I was going to like studying it in college versus studying it in high school After having done reasonably well in my toughest course that semester HST taught by Dr T J Davis and quite frankly really well everywhere else I knew that I d made a good choice Q What\u2019s something you learned while at ASU \u2014 in the classroom or otherwise \u2014 that surprised you or changed your perspective A As far as a class that changed my perspective surprised me I would be remiss to not mention AIS taught by Dr James Riding In in American Indian Studies Learning about the often tragic history and consequences of major Native American court cases was a bit depressing as one might imagine but it certainly was a class that was worth my while It was a major blind spot in my understanding of American history as a whole Q Why did you choose ASU A While I would imagine it would be easier if I was gung ho about the school s pride or a particular strength the reality is that it represented the best dollar for dollar value I could get as far as college goes Considering where I ended up with my degree going out of state \u2014 and its associated costs \u2014 would ve been a terrible mistake Q Which professor taught you the most important lesson while at ASU A My most important lesson would have to be from Dr Donald Critchlow and his lessons on principled pragmatism I learned it in a historical context how politicians had to compromise on ideology and ideals in order to forward ideas that they had to deem more important but I believe that this is important in life Some things are not to be compromised on but it s inevitable that compromises will occur so make sure they are anchored to larger and more important ideas Q What\u2019s the best piece of advice you\u2019d give to those still in school A It s cliche but for many people college will be about failure and not success I feel that many people don t know how to handle catastrophic failure when they get to college having performed so well prior to college and so minor mistakes can snowball into major failures If or when the time comes accepting failure adapting and then creating a new plan for success will be the only way forward Q What was your favorite spot on campus whether for studying meeting friends or just thinking about life A In terms of my favorite spots Noble Library \u2014 where I used to work \u2014 was always nice I always used to see a lot of friends there and the book collection was really well put together \u2014 now gone unfortunately If you do end up going there be prepared to wait in line for a really long time at Starbucks Q What are your plans after graduation A My long term goal is to commission as an officer in the U S Marine Corps To further this I enlisted in the Marine Reserves in late March to help prepare myself mentally and physically It s been my desire to serve in the military for a very long time and so it s exciting to finally take a concrete step towards service in the military", "page_url":

capitalize on a popular uprising in Lebanon unseen in the country\u2019s history Instead of doubling down on its support for the Lebanese Armed Forces LAF \u2014which would both bolster Lebanon\u2019s state institutions and put more pressure on Hezbollah\u2014the White House has done the opposite by freezing more than million in military aid The Trump administration is squandering a major opportunity to capitalize on a popular uprising in Lebanon unseen in the country\u2019s history Instead of doubling down on its support for the Lebanese Armed Forces LAF \u2014which would both bolster Lebanon\u2019s state institutions and put more pressure on Hezbollah\u2014the White House has done the opposite by freezing more than million in military aid The author of this controversial decision is U S President Donald Trump\u2019s National Security Council NSC which broke with the enduring U S bipartisan consensus on Lebanon policy But as bold as the White House\u2019s action is it should come as no surprise NSC staffers with responsibility for the Middle East have been aggressively trying to repurpose and downsize Lebanon\u2019s military assistance program for more than a year The effort was spearheaded by former National Security Advisor John Bolton but it continued apace even after his ousting by Trump on Sept Even though the Office of Management and Budget did not give a reason for the funding suspension the NSC\u2019s case should be familiar by now It argues that Hezbollah controls the Lebanese government and poses a security threat to Israel and until the LAF shows a greater commitment to challenging the militant party U S military aid will decrease There\u2019s another argument for the aid freeze that may have little to do with Lebanon Since assuming office Trump has strongly favored cutting foreign aid in general because he believes that the United States is not getting enough back from its friends The NSC has fulfilled his wish by instituting a new foreign assistance policy that is more frugal and more aligned with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d vision As a recipient of U S aid Lebanon like several other countries was a target of cuts\u2014and now a freeze None of the NSC\u2019s concerns about Lebanon and Hezbollah are inaccurate or unreasonable These concerns are shared by senior leadership in the Defense and State departments and U S Central Command Hezbollah which has more guns and combat experience than the Lebanese military does wield tremendous influence over politics in Beirut It alone decides when the country goes to war or makes peace and it has a predominant say in who gets to be president and prime minister But the disagreement in the U S government is not over the challenge Hezbollah represents to both Lebanon and U S policy That is all crystal clear Rather it is over how to most effectively address this challenge The White House views Lebanon through the narrow prism of its maximum pressure campaign against Iran And it seems to believe that halting aid to the Lebanese military will somehow compel its leadership to confront Iran\u2019s main ally Hezbollah Not only is this based on faulty logic but it is incredibly ill advised The Lebanese military does not have the means inclination or authority to forcefully counter Hezbollah All it can do is continue to present itself to Lebanese society as a credible alternative to the Shiite group which is a long term process Its leadership understands that any attempt at confronting Hezbollah which even the mighty Israeli army couldn\u2019t do successfully will result in the splintering of the military along sectarian lines and the possible return to civil war However the LAF has pushed back against Hezbollah by refusing to quell the protest which has been the party\u2019s wish all along and by stopping its thugs and those of its Shiite ally Amal from clashing with the protesters Two years ago the LAF dismissed Hezbollah\u2019s bizarre concerns over fighting the Islamic State along the borders and did a fantastic job evicting scores of terrorists from the country The Lebanese military operates on the basis of political consensus which is currently broken due to the ongoing protests against the country\u2019s entire political class It has no independent power or room for maneuvering in Lebanon\u2019s dysfunctional albeit democratic setting This is not the Egyptian or Pakistani army That the Trump administration has chosen to punish it regardless\u2014even though it has been an impeccable partner in the fight against the Islamic State and al Qaeda\u2014is baffling This measure also puts Washington in a much weaker position in its efforts to persuade the Lebanese military\u2019s commander Gen Joseph Aoun not to entertain Russian offers of support which have already come in droves The suspension of military aid also couldn\u2019t come at a worse time At present the Lebanese Army is frantically trying to prevent sectarian clashes across the country It needs all the help it can get Its efforts to protect a nationwide and multireligious uprising against a corrupt political order\u2014of which Hezbollah is the main architect\u2014have been anything but easy And it has been widely praised by most Lebanese and should be welcomed by Washington because the military directly serves U S objectives in Lebanon What is apparently missing in the White House\u2019s action is a serious assessment of the likely consequences of its new approach which include compromised access to the Levant and Eastern Mediterranean a relative weakening of the U S position in the global power competition with Russia and the possible loss of a highly capable counterterrorism partner The NSC may have privately made that assessment and concluded that the consequences are tolerable Or it hasn\u2019t and is simply indifferent The former is dangerous because a U S policy toward Lebanon that doesn\u2019t have the buy in of the Defense and State departments is a recipe for disaster The latter is even more dangerous because it signals a scary determination to try anything new against Hezbollah even if it tears Lebanon apart To be sure for now Centcom\u2019s leadership will safeguard its most precious investment in the region The suspended funds will not immediately impact Centcom\u2019s planning for Lebanon as there\u2019s still around million in the bank that hasn\u2019t been used But the longer the freeze goes and it\u2019s reported to be indefinite the more dangerous things become The suspension is a bad idea all around Despite all the political risks the Lebanese military has chosen to be on the right side of Lebanon\u2019s history\u2014supporting the aspirations of free minded Lebanese and thus indirectly undermining a political environment in which Hezbollah has thrived Washington should reward it not punish it", "page_url":

Something is loading Thousands of Army Navy and Air Force healthcare providers have surged to New York City since late March to help keep the country s hardest hit area from being overwhelmed by a need for hospital beds and medical staff So far the thousands of beds provided by a converted convention center and a hospital ship have not been needed but the extra personnel are coming in handy for the city s civilian hospitals The military has been averaging more than new troops a day with COVID About doctors nurses respiratory therapists and others are working in New York s medical centers where bed space has not been overwhelmed but where hospital acquired coronavirus cases have sidelined civilian staff Every day we seem to on board another hospital with a different sister service Capt Joe Kochan executive officer Operational Health Support Unit Portsmouth in Virginia told Military Times April As it stands right now we re really pushing out into the hospitals to address their needs Kochan s unit is one of several including the Army s 9th Field Hospital and Air Force s 927th Aerospace Medical Squadron who are on manning the Jacob K Javits Convention Center and surging into local

running their own intensive care space in some hospitals Kochan said while others are providing extra hands to regular operations We have the ability to scale up to whatever the demands are based on the needs of the city or any particular mission that is required Lt Col Leslie Curtis the 9th Field Hospitals chief nursing officer told reporters In addition to stationing themselves in hospitals there are teams going out on missions to support emergency response Curtis said more than two dozen teams at this point Officials could not say how many of their personnel had contracted coronavirus since arriving in New York DoD expands care to COVID patients in three locations Those numbers are being tracked but I can t comment on that Col Jennifer Ratcliff who commands the 927th Aerospace Medical Squadron told Military Times We re in the hospital so unless it s happened to someone on my team I m not aware of those numbers In any case Ratcliff said healthcare workers are taking every precaution to stop the spread donning the same complement of personal protective gear for each patient whether that person is specifically being treated for COVID or not We re treating everyone as if they re COVID positive she said because it s safer to assume given the tens of thousands of cases in New York City It s more likely that someone is COVID positive than COVID negative Loading Something

"My Love and Hate Relationship with Hackathons", "text": "My First Hackathon I was hanging out at one of my favorite developer communities devto and I ran into a post written by one of the admins at Devto announcing that Twilio was hosting their hackathon at Devto The hackathon is hosted online so you don\u2019t have to relocate to participate I happen to be in quarantine during the COVID pandemic so given my abundance of time and boredom I joined my first hackathon What is a hackathon Feel free to skip this part if you already know what it is or if you want to validate what I am saying is for the most part accurate \u201cA hackathon is simply a gathering of developers who share similar interests and are trying to solve some problem in society using current technologies\u201d Hieu Nguyen The general gists of it is They propose a theme You brainstorm some ideas around that theme by yourself or with other people Once you have an idea start planning and implementing it Testing and fine tuning your application Show time there is usually a chance for you to present your project or post it on some forum for others to see Receive feedbacks this is very useful because other developers some are a lot better than you Trust me I learned from personal experience will look at your application and point of things that you might have missed or complement you on the things they liked The goal is not to produce a battle tested application with many features It is about working together and building something minimally functional to showcase your ideas Think of it as planting the seed Theme and Brainstorming For this particular hackathon the themes were COVID Communications an app to help folks communicate during this challenging time either to stay connected or to help resolve COVID related challenges Engaging Engagements an app that a company could implement to better engage with their customers or to manage their business Interesting Integrations an app that integrates Twilio with at least one other API Exciting X Factors an innovative or unexpected app that doesn\u2019t necessarily fit any of the above categories but is a clear winner nonetheless learn more Note you have to integrate one of the Twilio API into your application Otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be called the Twilio Hackathon My approach to comming up with an idea I did not rush head first into the hackathon like many people would Yes there was a time limit However it is entirely up to you to manage your own project so I waited a good week or so During this time I was searching for ideas and looking at other people\u2019s submissions to gain some inspiration The worst thing that can happen is you did something that some else did To avoid this do your research and really think outside the box Some questions you might asks are What problems am I facing that I can solve using technology Do other people also have this problem Are there existing technologies that fix or alleviate this problem Can the existing solution to this problem be improved and maybe I can make it better My humble beginnings Since this was my first hackathon I decided to take the safe route and choose something very simple A lot of people think that at every hackathon you have to build something complex with a lot of functionalities Yes there will be submissions that are crazy advanced and complicated but bare in mind that it is YOUR hackathon experience You are free to go at your own pace So in this spirit I built an app that lets you sign up for an account with your phone number set a timer and once the timer runs out you get a text message telling you get off your electron device and offers a suggestion for something else you can do I called it Device Police I know not the greatest idea or name for that matter but it suited my level of experience and was achievable within the time constraint view full submission What I love about hackathons Own your ideas the nature of a hackthon to challenge your critical thinking and creativity really helps you to think of new ideas You are your own boss Unlike a school project or a work project a hackathon project is for the most part controlled entirely by you Besides the theme and several criteria that they imposed you are not really restricted by any schedule or standards You want to build it the night before the submission deadline Go at it The internet is your oyster Meeting awesome people Sometimes you get to team up with complete strangers with a completely different set of perspectives and skills This is really good because whatever skill you lack that person might be able to compensate and vice versa Many of these relationships can last a lifetime They could be your future co worker at a startup or a friend who considers coding as a conversational topic Building presense Think of a hackathon as an audition for programmers You prepare your act polish it show up on audition day and cross your finger hoping you pass Hackathons provide a stage and an audience that may include potential employers Even if you don\u2019t win it being present and making something cool and useful is enough to turn a couple eyes in your direction Free and unlimited membership Most of the time a hackathon is sponsored by some big company who are willing to spare a small percentage of their fortune to scout potential hires or to establish interests in a certain field For you that means admission is typically free The only thing you pay is time passion and maybe a little dignity You will make mistakes but don\u2019t let that discourage or prevent you from joining a hackathon Keep in mind that you are surrounded by people who makes a living by fixing bugs or faults in an application that is how you learn What I don\u2019t like about Hackathons Note Some of these do not apply to hackathons hosted online but they are fair expectations of an in person hackathon Unrealistic time constraint a lot of hackathons tends to span a day or two This small window translates to sloppy code and bugs Many projects fall through because they could not accommodate a roadblock or a nasty bug Toxic environment If you\u2019ve attended a hackathon in person then you probably have noticed that they are usually not organized with health and productivity in mind You are in this crowded space Lots of talking and cursing a natural tendency when your codes doesn\u2019t work When it comes to food offerings don\u2019t expect a michelin star meal They often prep pizzas caffeinated drinks and other unhealthy food Too much socializing and not enough coding One of the perks of being at a hackathon is meeting people However like they always say too much of a good things is a bad thing It can become very distracting when you are trying to complete your project and socialize at the same time Should you join a hackathon If you haven\u2019t been to one before then I would definitely advise to try it at least once If you have previous experiences with hackathons then make your best judgement and considered how much value you gained from attending it If it wasn\u2019t good what could you have done differently How could the organizers make it better Would you consider doing an online hackathon", "page_url": "https://www.devsurvival.com/my-love-and-hate-relationship-with-hackathons/", "label": 1, "score":

looking rival the horse has hardly anything in hand over Chancheng Prince or Sea Monarch on that showing but that loss of composure may have cost him If he behaves better on this second outing he can justify the faith shown by punters that day Demons Rock seems likely to be a short price for a horse that hasn\u2019t won since he was a two year old entire with Tom Dascombe in the summer of A compelling case is hard to make for any of these but Fairy Floss could be worth chancing since his only previous start on dirt was also the closest he has come to success It has taken time but Fabulous Eight now looks like making good on the promise he showed in late His third place last month was easily his best effort since then and he can be marked up a bit having twice met trouble in running From an in form stable and with Jo\u00e3o Moreira aboard he is sure to be a warm order Others have more obvious claims but there was a lot to like about Mig Energy \u2019s fifth place at Happy Valley just over a fortnight ago He wasn\u2019t beaten far that day after chasing too hot a pace while the pair who forced it finished out the back Hopefully a wide draw means he will avoid getting drawn into an early pace battle and if so he has the talent to get involved The tactically versatile Excel Delight is perhaps best suited by creeping into contention which was how he scored here in February He nearly pulled off the same trick a fortnight ago when beaten by inches by a classy young rival and will be unlucky to find something of similar talent in this field This drop in class is interesting for Monster Kaka who has dropped 20lb since starting in Hong Kong a year ago and now looks well treated and ready to win He was a major eye catcher when storming into third place a fortnight ago and the extra furlong should help The lightly raced Snow Airjet may also be worth a second look Rather like his days with James Fanshawe Enzemble has taken time to put it all together in

from sites in Custer Wash It is not known how or where the hornet first arrived in North America Insects are frequently transported in international cargo and are sometimes transported deliberately At home in the forests and low mountains of eastern and southeast Asia the hornet feeds on large insects including native wasps and bees In Japan it devastates the European honey bee which has no effective defense Asian giant hornets are usually about to inches in length with an orange yellow head and striped abdomen Photo courtesy WSDA The Asian giant hornet\u2019s life cycle begins in April when queens emerge from hibernation feed on plant sap and fruit and look for an underground dens to build their nests Once established colonies grow and send out workers to find food and prey Hornets are most destructive in the late summer and early fall when they are on the hunt for sources of protein to raise next year\u2019s queens V mandarinia attack honey bee hives killing adult bees and devouring bee larvae and pupae while aggressively defending the occupied colony Their stings are big and painful with a potent neurotoxin Multiple stings can kill humans even if they are not allergic

restrictions in the magazine we were forced to shorten it somewhat This article contains quite a bit of additional information not printed in the magazine version One seldom hears the true story of what happened at the place where the world changed How it began What were the reasons What were the costs John Parker Hammond This quote from Trespasser \u2019s intro movie serves just as well to open the real story of a game development team\u2019s struggles to develop a breakthrough dinosaur game as it does to open the fictional story of Hammond\u2019s struggle to develop a biotechnological breakthrough and clone dinosaurs The parallels between the Trespasser project and Hammond\u2019s cloning project were numerous ambitious beginnings years of arduous labor and the eventual tragic ending Hammond\u2019s diary as related in the game itself dwells on the past and never attempts to explain Hammond\u2019s future direction now that he has failed so grandly this postmortem is intended to be much more forward looking Trespasser was begun by two former employees of Looking Glass Technologies Seamus Blackley and Austin Grossman By the time the game was rolling two more ex Looking Glass employees would join the team and our common background was instrumental in setting the direction for the project Looking Glass\u2019s most distinguished products Underworld I and II and System Shock are games which in some ways are still ahead of their time specifically in the areas of object rich physics based environments and emergent gameplay Quake did not even ship until after coding on Trespasser had begun and to the Trespasser team with its founding in Looking Glass\u2019s design focused philosophy it represented the stagnation of 3D games rather than the step forward it was proclaimed in the press Quake did nothing to extend the basic first person shooter game design standards of find weapons and keys which id had first created in Wolfenstein 3D and replaced the fairly consistent atmospheres of Wolfenstein 3D and Doom with a bizarre mishmash of medieval and science fiction themes Trespasser was intended to be a high technology game where game design and world consistency came first Trespasser concept sketch zoom The Jurassic Park license was inevitable from the start for a couple reasons The obvious reason was that Lost World was on its way and expected to be a gigantic hit and standard Hollywood thinking dictates that all projected hits be exploited seven ways to Sunday The less obvious reason was that Seamus had been working on a physically simulated biped model originally intended for Terra Nova and had been shopping it around to several movie animation groups working on dinosaurs before ending up at DreamWorks Interactive The pie in the sky concept for Trespasser was an outdoor engine with no levels a complete rigid body physics simulation and behaviorally simulated and physics modeled dinosaurs The underlying design goal was to achieve a realistic feel through consistency of looks and behavior Having an abandoned island setting was a useful way to exclude anything which did not seem possible to simulate such as flexible solids like cloth and rope wheeled vehicles and the effects of burning cutting and digging The game would play from a first person perspective and you would experience the environment through a virtual body to avoid the floating gun feeling prevalent in the Wolfenstein breed of first person games Combat would be less important than in a shooter and dinosaurs would be much more dangerous than traditional first person shooter enemies The point of the game would be exploration and puzzle solving and when combat happened it would more often involve frightening opponents away by inflicting pain than the merciless slaughter of every moving creature Limited but rich was a phrase which was used often early in Trespasser\u2019s development This phrase describes a game design philosophy consisting of choosing a reduced feature set but putting more sophistication into each feature Although solid body physics based entirely on box shaped solids might seem like only a rough approximation of the real world the thinking was that a perfect simulation of solid boxes would be so much more flexible than the emulated physics of previous games that our gameplay would be deep and absorbing Trespasser concept sketch zoom Likewise though we would only have a few different types of dinosaurs the dinosaur AI system would allow them to react to each other and the player in a large variety of ways choosing appropriate responses depending on their emotional state Sophisticated fully interruptable scenes would occur spontaneously rather than requiring large amounts of scripting and observing the food chain in action would be as absorbing as playing the game itself Interacting with the limited but rich features would lead to emergent gameplay the grail for many of Looking Glass\u2019 best thinkers since Underworld I shipped and fans began to write in describing favorite moments moments which had not been specifically designed or even experienced by the team itself The original plan for Trespasser certainly seemed like a good one It was very ambitious but the team had made tradeoffs for implementation and execution time from the very beginning such as not attempting to do multiple or moving light sources or Quake style shadow generation in order to accommodate arbitrary numbers of moving objects and long wide open views Unfortunately there is a difference between having a plan and successfully executing it and the product that we eventually shipped was as disappointing to us as it was to the great majority of game players and game critics", "page_url":
