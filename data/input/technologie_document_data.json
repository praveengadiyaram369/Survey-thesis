h\u00e4ufig auf dringendere Probleme verwiesen Das ist richtig verst\u00e4ndlich und kann im Hinblick auf die Art und den Umfang der Umsetzung der erforderlichen Schutzma\u00dfnahmen ber\u00fccksichtigt werden Au\u00dfer Frage steht dagegen ob die Schutzma\u00dfnahmen umgesetzt werden m\u00fcssen Denn sie dienen nicht nur dem Schutz von personenbezogenen Daten oder von Gesch\u00e4ftsgeheimnissen Es geht generell um Datensicherheit also vor allem um den Schutz von internen IT Infrastrukturen und damit um die essentielle Funktionsf\u00e4higkeit von Unternehmen oder Organisationen Zul\u00e4ssigkeit eines Homeoffice Der einfachste Weg eine Homeoffice Regelung zu treffen ist eine einvernehmliche Vereinbarung zwischen Mitarbeitern und Arbeitgebern Eine zwangsweise Anordnung einer Homeoffice Nutzung kommt dagegen genauso wie ein Recht von Mitarbeitern auf ein Homeoffice allenfalls in akuten Notlagen in Frage Das hei\u00dft es m\u00fcssten schon Infektionsf\u00e4lle im B\u00fcro aufgetreten oder andere Schutzma\u00dfnahmen wie Hygiene Raumtrennung Anmietung anderer R\u00e4umlichkeiten oder \u00e4hnliches nicht m\u00f6glich oder nicht ausreichend sein Dr jur Thomas Schwenke ist Rechtsanwalt in Berlin ber\u00e4t international Unternehmen im Marketing sowie Datenschutzrecht ist zertifizierter Datenschutzauditor podcastet unter Rechtsbelehrung com und ist Betreiber der Plattform Datenschutz Generator de Vor allem jedoch sollte bedacht werden dass etwaige Verpflichtungen und Vereinbarungen f\u00fcr die Mitarbeiter umsetzbar und zumutbar sein m\u00fcssen Allerdings sind die Anforderungen an einen Heimarbeitsplatz gar nicht so hoch wie h\u00e4ufig angenommen R\u00e4umliche Voraussetzungen Traditionell wird ein abschlie\u00dfbarer Raum als Heimarbeitsplatz empfohlen was auch zu unterst\u00fctzen ist Allerdings geht es auch ohne einen abschlie\u00dfbaren Raum Vor allem bei einem papierlosen B\u00fcro wird es vor allem auf die technische Sicherheit der zuhause verwendeten Ger\u00e4te und Onlinezug\u00e4nge ankommen Wer also alleine wohnt und Ger\u00e4te sperren und mit etwaigen Akten wegsperren kann der wird auch ohne einen abschlie\u00dfbaren Raum zu Hause arbeiten k\u00f6nnen Technische Voraussetzungen Das Hauptaugenmerk liegt beim Homeoffice auf der technischen Sicherheit Dazu geh\u00f6rt zum einen die Sicherheit der Ger\u00e4te selbst als auch ihrer Nutzung und der verwendeten Schnittstellen Zur Sicherheit der Ger\u00e4te geh\u00f6rt vor allem dass sie im Hinblick auf die Software und Schutzsysteme wie Firewalls und Virenerkennung auf dem aktuellen Stand sind Die betrieblichen Daten sollten zudem nur verschl\u00fcsselt gespeichert werden um auch im Fall eines etwaigen Diebstahls gesch\u00fctzt zu sein Bei Schnittstellen ist an das heimische WLAN zu denken das entsprechend dem Stand der Technik verschl\u00fcsselt sein sollte Dennoch sollte die Einwahl in die IT Infrastruktur des Arbeitgebers stets durch eine besonders gesicherte Verbindung VPN erfolgen Bluetooth und andere Nahfeldtechnologien sollten bis auf die F\u00e4lle erforderlicher Nutzung ausgeschaltet bleiben Ferner sollte der Einsatz von USB Speichern untersagt oder auf betriebliche Speicher beschr\u00e4nkt werden deren Herausgabe im Optimalfall registriert wird Ansonsten sollte ein Datenaustausch via sicherer betrieblicher Cloudspeicher favorisiert werden Sicherheit bei der Nutzung Die sichere Nutzung von Ger\u00e4ten setzt vor allem die Verwendung hinreichend sicherer Zugangsdaten voraus Dabei sind eine Passwortmanagementsoftware sowie lange am besten mind Zeichen und f\u00fcr Menschen nicht merkbarer Passw\u00f6rter einem h\u00e4ufigen Austausch merkbarer Passw\u00f6rter vorzuziehen Des Weiteren sollte die Nutzung von betrieblichen Daten auf einen erforderlichen Umfang begrenzt werden So sollten Lese und Schreibrechte innerhalb interner IT Infrastruktur generell auf das N\u00f6tigste beschr\u00e4nkt werden Need to know Prinzip Ebenso sollte Mitarbeitern klar sein dass sie beruflich genutzte Ger\u00e4te nicht aus den Augen lassen d\u00fcrfen und sonst den Zugang zu ihnen oder betrieblichen Bereichen auf den Ger\u00e4ten sperren m\u00fcssen Das gilt ganz besonders f\u00fcr die mobile Nutzung Sicherheit im Mobileoffice Mit Mobileoffice sind mobile Arbeitspl\u00e4tze also beispielsweise in der Bahn in Co Working Spaces oder mit Smartphone in der Hand morgens beim B\u00e4cker gemeint Bei mobiler Nutzung besteht die besondere Gefahr dass Ger\u00e4te gestohlen Bildschirme ausgesp\u00e4ht oder Telefonate abgeh\u00f6rt werden Daher sollten Ger\u00e4te beim Verlassen von mobilen Arbeitspl\u00e4tzen nicht nur gesperrt sondern auch mitgenommen werden Ferner sollten Blickschutzfilter verwendet und in H\u00f6rweite unbefugter Personen keine vertraulichen Informationen ausgetauscht werden weswegen auch der Einsatz von \u201elauschenden\u201c digitalen Assistenten im Homeoffice untersagt werden sollte Einsatz von Privatger\u00e4ten f\u00fcr berufliche Zwecke Die eindeutige Empfehlung lautet Mitarbeitern betriebliche Computer oder Smartphones zur Nutzung im Homeoffice bereitzustellen Denn auf Privatger\u00e4ten sind die Kontrollm\u00f6glichkeiten des Arbeitgebers und damit automatisch auch die Datensicherheit erheblich eingeschr\u00e4nkt Werden Privatger\u00e4te eingesetzt bekannt unter dem Schlagwort \u201eBring Your Own Device\u201c kurz BYOD dann steht einer effektiven Kontrolle die Privatsph\u00e4re der Mitarbeiter entgegen Es muss dann zwangsl\u00e4ufig eine Vereinbarung getroffen werden die es dem Arbeitgeber erlaubt die betrieblichen Informationen zu kontrollieren und im Optimalfall auch aus der Ferne zu l\u00f6schen Um die Privatsph\u00e4re nicht zu verletzen und die Datenkontrolle zu gew\u00e4hrleisten sollten Trennungspflichten vereinbart werden Einsatz von privater Software Beim Einsatz von Software sollte nach M\u00f6glichkeit betrieblich installierte und eingerichtete Software verwendet werden Zum einen weil neben dem Datenschutz das Urheberrecht und die Zul\u00e4ssigkeit einer betrieblichen Nutzung beachtet werden muss Auch sind h\u00e4ufig Datenschutzfunktionen Auftragsverarbeitungs und andere erforderliche Datenschutzvereinbarungen auf Gesch\u00e4ftsversionen der Software beschr\u00e4nkt Vor allem sollte auch die eingesetzte Kommunikations und Konferenzsoftware gepr\u00fcft und freigegeben werden Anleitung des Autors und Folge des Auslegungssache Podcasts der c\u2019t zur DSGVO Sicherheit von Konferenzsoftware Nicht zuletzt kann dank dedizierter betrieblicher Software auch die erforderliche Trennung von betrieblichen und privaten Daten effektiver eingehalten werden Trennungspflichten Auch wenn der Beruf und das Privatleben sich zunehmend vermischen sollten betriebliche Daten stets von privaten Daten getrennt bleiben Denn nur so kann gew\u00e4hrleistet werden dass der Arbeitgeber bei der Aus\u00fcbung seiner Kontroll und L\u00f6schungsrechte die Privatsph\u00e4re der Mitarbeiter nicht verletzt Daher sollten betriebliche Daten vorzugsw\u00fcrdig auf betrieblichen Cloudspeichern oder Softwarecontainern gespeichert und Weboberfl\u00e4chen f\u00fcr Zugang zu betrieblichen E Mails verwendet werden Nicht nur bei besonders sch\u00fctzenswerten Daten z B Gesundheitsdaten oder wertvollen Gesch\u00e4ftsgeheimnissen sollten die Ger\u00e4te daher am besten von der IT Abteilung mit Einverst\u00e4ndnis der Mitarbeiter eingerichtet oder freigegeben werden Verpflichtung und Schulung All die vorgenannten Schutzma\u00dfnahmen sind wirkungslos wenn sie in der Praxis nicht umgesetzt werden Die wichtigste Voraussetzung ist daher dass Mitarbeiter ihre Schutzpflichten kennen Dazu empfiehlt es sich die Pflichten als Teil von Vereinbarungen \u00fcber Homeoffice oder Privatger\u00e4te samt einem Vorbehalt betrieblicher Kontrolle aufzunehmen oder sonst separat auszuh\u00e4ndigen Die Kenntnisnahme der Pflichten sollte aus Nachweisgr\u00fcnden schriftlich oder auch per E Mail von den Mitarbeitern best\u00e4tigt werden Daneben sollten Mitarbeiter auch in Workshops geschult oder individuell instruiert werden In jedem Fall sollte sichergestellt sein dass die Mitarbeiter die Schutzpflichten tats\u00e4chlich verstanden haben und umsetzen k\u00f6nnen Beteiligung des Betriebsrats und der Personalvertretung Die Arbeitnehmervertretung muss an der Einf\u00fchrung von Homeoffice oder der Nutzung von Privatger\u00e4ten zu betrieblichen Zwecken beteiligt werden im Regelfall im Rahmen einer Betriebsvereinbarung Denn mit der Verrichtung der Arbeitst\u00e4tigkeit mittels von technischen Ger\u00e4ten besteht stets zumindest die M\u00f6glichkeit dass Mitarbeiter \u00fcberwacht werden Abs Nr BetrVG Homeoffice Verbote in Vertr\u00e4gen Arbeitgeber sollten in Vertr\u00e4gen mit Gesch\u00e4ftspartnern pr\u00fcfen ob Ihnen die Verarbeitung von betrieblichen Daten im Homeoffice nicht untersagt ist So findet sich in vielen Auftragsverarbeitungsvertr\u00e4gen eine Klausel die Verarbeitung von Daten der Auftraggeber im Homeoffice untersagt oder von deren Zustimmung abh\u00e4ngig macht Allerdings spricht die aktuelle Krisenlage daf\u00fcr dass Gesch\u00e4ftspartner eine Zustimmung generell nicht grundlos versagen d\u00fcrfen Das gilt zumindest dann wenn die Sicherheitsma\u00dfnahmen im Homeoffice eingehalten werden Corona als Rechtfertigung Vorgaben zum Schutz von personenbezogenen Daten und Gesch\u00e4ftsgeheimnissen sind selten starr formuliert sondern richten sich an den Umst\u00e4nden des Einzelfalls z B Art Abs Abs DSGVO oder \u00a7 Abs b GeschGehG Auch im Fall der beh\u00f6rdlichen Ma\u00dfnahmen oder der Verh\u00e4ngung von Bu\u00dfgeldern muss die M\u00f6glichkeit und Zumutbarkeit der Umsetzung von Schutzvorschriften beachtet werden Daher ist davon auszugehen dass Beh\u00f6rden darauf R\u00fccksicht nehmen werden wenn etwa eine Schulung nachgereicht wird und zuerst nur die wichtigsten Instruktionen erfolgen Allerdings sollten Sicherheitsma\u00dfnahmen m\u00f6glichst schnell nachgeholt werden Zusammenfassung und Praxisempfehlung Bei der Arbeit au\u00dferhalb der Betriebsst\u00e4tte m\u00fcssen besondere technische und organisatorische Ma\u00dfnahmen ergriffen werden Vor allem zum Schutz betrieblicher Daten und Informationen m\u00fcssen Mitarbeitern Schutzpflichten auferlegt und Kontrollm\u00f6glichkeiten des Arbeitgebers sichergestellt werden In einem papierlosen B\u00fcro kommt es dabei vor allem auf eine Verschl\u00fcsselung von Daten auf den Ger\u00e4ten sichere Passw\u00f6rter und Daten\u00fcbertragungswege an Im Optimalfall sollten Mitarbeiter dabei vom Arbeitgeber gestellte Ger\u00e4te nutzen Sollten doch Privatger\u00e4te verwendet werden m\u00fcssen private von betrieblichen Daten strikt getrennt werden Zwar werden sich Arbeitgeber gegen\u00fcber Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rden durchaus auf die aktuelle Krise berufen k\u00f6nnen Allerdings sollten Verpflichtungen von Mitarbeitern auf die Schutzpflichten und vor allen deren Instruktion m\u00f6glichst schnell erfolgen Vor allem weil die Corona Krise von kriminellen Personen eher als Chance denn als Hinderungsgrund gesehen werden d\u00fcrfte Weiterf\u00fchrende Informationen finden Sie auch in diesem Blogbeitrag Checkliste Wann

commanders DIU says the project is necessary because the data coming in from military sensors around the world \u2014 whether they are mounted on a fighter jet or a soldier\u2019s helmet \u2014 is arriving faster than current command and control stations can process DIU wants solutions that can leverage \u201cautomated metadata correlation\u201d and other emerging techniques to rapidly process many types of data DIU\u2019s effort on the Army\u2019s ground station is happening parallel to announcements for work on similar aerial units Connecting sensors to shooters is the main goal of the new network of network program called Joint All Domain Command and Control or JADC2 to which the TITAN appears to be linked based on its description The ground station will receive most data via satellites and need to be able to transmit data beyond line of sight communications according to the posting The rapid data processing will help assist the Army in developing precision long range firing weapons one of its top weapons modernization priorities The system will need to utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning as one of the means to speed up the dissemination of data To fully use AI the ground station will need to use both edge computing and cloud based computing power \u201cThe access node should be a modular open systems architecture making it easy to upgrade software firmware analytics algorithms and ingest additional data streams \u201d the posting states The final product should be small enough to mount on a large Army vehicle and will have to rugged enough to withstand \u201coperational environments \u201d according to the announcement The node would be larger than other similar nodes already deployed and would be powered by a kilowatt electricity generator It would link to a government furnished satellite receiver that would need to be mounted on a large truck Responses to the request are due by April", "page_url":

reliable and deploying the most advanced technology available an operator\u2019s PPE must also be as comfortable mobile and lightweight as possible This is particularly true of the ballistic helmet which operators may be required to wear for extended periods in challenging environments The helmet system is comprised of an external hard shell an internal liner and suspension system to achieve a customized fit and minimize head acceleration and deceleration Internal pads provide impact protection and comfort and the retention device such as a chinstrap keeps it all in the correct position The helmet\u2019s purpose is to protect against a range of ballistic threats and also to help reduce the risk of suffering a traumatic brain injury TBI EQUIPPED TO PERFORM The average U S warfighter carries at least pounds of gear with an extended patrol often double that weight Every component and accessory increases the load which is particularly felt when added to the helmet \u201cWe often

3M to push the technology envelope on design and manufacturing They then work with their industry partners such as D3O to explore enhanced impact protection \u201cThe geometry and mass of a helmet\u2019s accoutrements can affect its blunt impact protection and comfort \u201d adds David Jackson U S Defense Program Manager at D3O who has more than years of defense experience \u201cAlso impact energies are increasing As we move from the requirement for a helmet to resist an object with an impact speed of feet per second to feet per second and beyond it\u2019s vital that the helmet shell and suspension pads work together \u201d MAXIMUM PROTECTION LOWEST WEIGHT Current and future defense and law enforcement personnel will benefit from innovations in materials geometries and design combined with new manufacturing equipment and methodologies \u201cWe have found ways to lay the suspension pads in the helmet to increase the number of contact points with the head thus maximizing comfort \u201d says Bill VanMullekom of D3O The outcome believes Jackson will be helmets offering maximum protection at the lowest weight and with the greatest possible comfort \u201cD3O

chess and Go artificial intelligence has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to outwit the experts Ad networks and recommendation engines are getting eerily good at predicting what consumers want to buy next Artificial intelligence it seems is changing many aspects of our lives especially on the internet But what has been described as a revolution in artificial intelligence hasn\u2019t yet swept the U S military While there are frequent forecasts that AI will revolutionize military work there is a huge difference in the breadth and depth of AI adoption in the military and online commerce and the difference has a lot to do with the data available to military AI systems The data that the U S military needs in order to train AI algorithms to recognize for example the signals coming from adversary sensors or platforms are difficult to collect AI algorithms\u2014in particular deep learning variants\u2014generally require huge amounts of data that is accurately labeled and relevant to each specific problem domain Military adversaries develop sophisticated tactics and technologies to prevent the collection of this data or try to ensure that we get the wrong data With corrupted information about the military situation decisions we make may be far from optimal handing an advantage to the adversary This is especially true in dynamic conflict situations in which technologically advanced adversaries struggle to gain information about their opponents using electromagnetic sensors and communications links In these scenarios each side simultaneously engages in electronic warfare EW to deny the use of those same sensors and communications links When algorithms are used to adapt to these dynamic EW interactions the kinds of learning applied to strategy games like Go is much more difficult to implement There are defense applications in which modern AI algorithms do well such as recognizing complex patterns\u2014or changes\u2014in images or signals that can be collected in bulk by intelligence sensors Satellite sensors for example can collect data on large areas over time and look for patterns of change in agricultural use construction transportation and shipbuilding Algorithms designed to detect such changes can greatly reduce time consuming efforts to sort a massive pile of videos and images The U S Defense Department\u2019s Project Maven for example collects large samples of video that is then labeled by analysts as to what kinds of activities were recorded Then deep learning AI is used to recognize similar patterns in new videos The U S military has seen great success in rolling out autonomous vehicles\u2014another class of systems that have been subsumed under the ever widening scope of \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d\u2014but these systems are largely controlled by algorithms that differ from many AI applications These systems are largely guided by algorithms that are carefully crafted by engineers to ensure that the vehicles behave in predictable ways and while these vehicle control algorithms are adaptable they do not learn their basic behavior from millions of examples through trial and error like deep learning methods In these cases the development and behaviors of key algorithms is based on data that is relatively safe from denial or deception by an adversary Is more advanced AI actually secretly flourishing throughout the military but unknown to civilians because of classification restrictions The answer is no It is true that specific system capabilities tactics or vulnerabilities must remain classified But Department of Defense programs regularly share unclassified success stories in order to inspire new workers to enter the field entice business to invest their internal R D dollars to compete and to justify continued funding Oversight of the DoD budget requires most programs to provide some description of their purpose and progress By contrast some of the internet\u2019s most popular platforms are designed to produce data that is being fed back into AI systems and improve their performance Every day billions of internet users post data about their activity That data is often labeled with captions hashtags locations or links to friends These bits of related data contain information about the subjects of images we post our individual interests social networks preferences and so on As social media and internet commerce platforms absorb and store this data they accumulate enormous databases that are ideal for training testing and rapidly improving AI algorithms These AI algorithms are used in turn to infer our individual interests and then sell information about us to advertisers Advertisers then then make decisions as to whether to pay for an ad that pops up on the screen This game is for the most part cooperative we users provide access to our behavioral and preference data and in return get free information as well as recommendations while internet platforms provide free services to us and get money from selling ads In the vast majority of daily data transactions there is no player in this game that is trying to corrupt the decisions being made The military simply has no comparable sources of data to feed into its systems Social media companies get data for free while the military has to build specialized systems and pay people to collect and label information And the data it most seeks\u2014about adversary systems and behavior\u2014is the most difficult to collect and requires careful sorting to avoid deception While the military will continue to face a decision environment enveloped in the fog of war popular games will continue to be learned through hundreds of millions of online plays in order to train the next AI The military will need to continue to struggle to collect data for use in automating decisions particularly against increasingly sophisticated adversaries AI may prove useful in solving some problems but it will be a long slow evolution In the meantime we should continue to invest in the widest range of theory computation and algorithms to improve our information driven systems in the face of much more sophisticated competition that we are facing now Tom Stefanick is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution", "page_url": "https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/why-the-ai-revolution-hasnt-swept-the-military/",

8kun made a somewhat brief appearance on the public Internet thanks to what amounts to an attack on the Internet s routing infrastructure The site s domain name server hosted by a service called VanwaNet offered up an Internet address for the site that was from an unallocated set of addresses belonging to the RIPE Network Coordinating Centre the regional Internet registry authority for Europe and the Middle East And the host for the new site the Russian hosting company Media Land LLC advertised a route to that address to the rest of the Internet allowing visitors to reach the site for a while The advertisement of the address made with the Border Gateway Protocol BGP is what is referred to in the routing world as a bogon or martian Usually these happen when private network addresses mistakenly are sent out or advertised from a network to the rest of the Internet because of a router misconfiguration But sometimes they hijack existing addresses either accidentally or maliciously A BGP leak in November caused Google and Spotify service outages In for example Hacking Team used a BGP bogon advertisement to help Italian police regain control of infrastructure used to monitor hacked targets And a Russian network provider made BGP advertisements that hijacked traffic to financial services sites in While 8kun net was registered in September through Tucows the actual process was handled by a company called N T Technology Inc a hosting company and registration services provider that appears to have gone dark in August around the same time 8Chan went offline The domain for N T Technology was registered by Jim Watkins\u2014the owner of 8chan And several hosts associated with 8chan on the 8ch net domain were hosted by N T Technology None of N T Technology s servers appears to be reachable The Twitter account associated with the company which gives the location as Carson City Nevada has been inactive since The address given for the company on its now dead website was a Digital Real Estate data center in San Francisco and its corporate office address was that of a corporation registration and virtual home office company in Reno Nevada The phone number associated with the Reno address in domain registration data was disconnected a second number a Comcast VoIP number went unanswered But the company s network is still active based on data from Hurricane Electric s BGP tools Trying to go \u201cBulletproof\u201d After 8chan lost its hosting in August in the wake of the El Paso mass shooting much of 8chan s content\u2014especially the pol channel\u2014had shifted to the social media platform Telegram known for its anti censorship policies which have made it a haven for all flavors of extremism Telegrampol for instance was set up in July But the fragmented nature of the Telegram channels and the Telegram architecture likely kept away many 8chan users Telegrampol has a total of subscribers 8kun was an effort to restore a central location for all of 8chan s communities but it faced the same challenges in hosting that brought down 8chan in the first place\u2014its radioactivity to hosting providers and domain registrars This is what apparently drove Watkins and company to a rather unusual hosting option a Russian company known mostly for hosting crimeware Media Land is operated by Alexander Volosovyk known as Yahlishanda on criminal underground Internet marketplaces According to a report by Brian Krebs Volosovyk is the world s biggest bulletproof hosting operator He has according to Krebs avoided takedowns and prosecution by operating carefully within the lines of the law in Russia and other former Soviet states Servers hosted by Media Land infrastructure have been tied to the Dridex and Zeus banking trojans in the past as well as to the command and control networks for other sophisticated malware Media Land hosted virtual private servers using legitimately assigned IP addresses have been repeatedly reported for malicious traffic including hundreds of brute force Remote Desktop Protocol login attacks Media Land used the fake BGP advertisements for more than just 8kun According to historical DNS records from SecurityTrails Media Land had been maintaining an advertisement for a block of addresses starting at for over a month with the records for 8kun net addresses popping up about two days ago The hosts tied to the address block hosted a variety of short lived malware phishing and online pharmacy scam sites among others with some dating back to September\u2014all of them hosted by Media Land Using this sort of fishy routing advertisement is not an uncommon tactic when trying to prevent potential attackers from gathering intelligence on a site s or network s infrastructure It means that Whois requests and other network tools return no useful information to casual inquiries That makes targeting the hosting provider somewhat more difficult Other blocks of unassigned addresses have been used by Media Land repeatedly over the past three years Going dim The Media Land hosting may have been a temporary move by the operators of 8chan 8kun The site remains live on Tor as a hidden service And the site s domain name service provider VanwaNet has advertised itself in the past as a Cloudflare alternative \u2014giving customers the capability at some point in the future to create their own content delivery networks to fight DDoS attacks Ron Watkins the administrator for 8kun said in a Twitter post that VanwaTech has built a fantastic new deepnet CDN that can deliver Tor hidden services at nearly clearnet speed In addition the 8kun team has apparently been looking at another Tor like service called Lokinet an onion routing based anonymizing network that is still in development Those services may be crucial for the continued operation of the site considering that the open Internet version of the site was under attack from almost the instant it went live We have been under sustained attacks the past few days and doing everything we can to get things stable again Ron Watkins reported on Twitter earlier today The site is still online\u2014albeit limping along\u2014as we

Online Kollaborationsplattform Microsoft Teams gefunden \u00fcber die sich mit Hilfe von manipulierten Bildern die Anmelde Session eines anderen Benutzers \u00fcbernehmen l\u00e4sst So kann ein Angreifer fremde Nutzerkonten allein dadurch kapern dass die Besitzer dieser Konten ein bestimmtes GIF angezeigt bekommen Dieser Angriff lie\u00dfe sich auch automatisiert ausf\u00fchren um zum Beispiel alle Teams Konten einer ganzen Organisation anzugreifen und vertrauliche Informationen Firmen Interna und Passw\u00f6rter abzugreifen Microsoft hat die L\u00fccke nach eigenen Angaben geschlossen und konnte bisher in der Praxis keine solche Angriffe feststellen Angriff ist nicht einfach umzusetzen Das mag wohl auch daran liegen dass eine erfolgreiche Durchf\u00fchrung des Angriffes nicht ganz trivial ist Zuerst einmal muss ein Angreifer es schaffen ein GIF in den Teams Chat einzuschleusen Entweder weil er bereits Zugang zu einem Teams Konto der Organisation hat zum Beispiel per Gast Zugang oder weil er es schafft einen Kontoinhaber davon zu \u00fcberzeugen ein vom Angreifer erstelltes GIF in den Chat zu posten Au\u00dferdem und das ist wohl weit schwieriger braucht der Angreifer Kontrolle \u00fcber eine Subdomain unter teams microsoft com \u2013 dass gro\u00dfe Unternehmen solche oftmals vergessenen Subdomains haben die auf die eine oder andere Weise angreifbar sind ist nicht ungew\u00f6hnlich Und auch bei Microsoft fanden Forscher in der Vergangenheit hunderte Subdomains die sich \u00fcber fehlerhafte DNS Einstellungen kapern lie\u00dfen Die Sicherheitsfirma CyberArk die diesen Angriff auf Microsoft Teams entdeckte fand zwei f\u00fcr sie interessante Domains Sowohl aadsync test teams microsoft com als auch data dev teams microsoft com lie\u00dfen sich kapern und f\u00fcr die Zwecke der Forscher missbrauchen Indem sie es schafften Traffic f\u00fcr diese Domains auf eigene Server umzuleiten schafften sie es dass Microsoft Teams die Session Token der Nutzer die das b\u00f6sartige GIF angezeigt bekamen an sie schickte Jedes Mal wenn ein Nutzer dieses GIF anschaute erhielten die Forscher per Session Token eine Stunde lang Zugang zu dessen Teams Konto Perfekt f\u00fcr CEO Fraud geeignet \u00dcber eine solche L\u00fccke k\u00f6nnten sich Angreifer theoretisch durch eine ganze Firma hangeln und haufenweise sensible Daten wie Gesch\u00e4ftsgeheimnisse oder Passw\u00f6rter f\u00fcr die IT Infrastruktur der Organisation abgreifen Au\u00dferdem eignet sich ein solcher Angriff hervorragend f\u00fcr CEO Fraud Man kapert so lange Konten bis man die Kontrolle \u00fcber das Teams Konto eines hochrangigen Mitarbeiters hat und ordnet dann an Gelder zu \u00fcberweisen oder Finanzdaten herauszugeben Mit der in Teams integrierten Kalender Funktionalit\u00e4t lassen sich solche Betr\u00fcgereien dann auch genau auf den Arbeitsalltag der Organisation abstimmen um weniger Aufsehen zu erregen Vor allem jetzt gerade wo immer mehr Firmen auf Microsoft Teams und \u00e4hnliche Dienste umsteigen und eh fast alle Mitarbeiter im Homeoffice arbeiten haben solche Angriffe wohl besonders hohe Erfolgschancen Microsoft scheint die L\u00fccke geschlossen zu haben indem man die entsprechenden Subdomains abgesichert hat Au\u00dferdem ist die Firma dabei ihre Kollaborations Software gegen \u00e4hnliche Angriffe zu h\u00e4rten

operating capability meaning the facility is fully constructed and able to execute all of its designed tasks The Seabees have been working hard through all the adversities we ve had out here to get this up and running as soon as possible said Navy Lt Matthew Harms the operations officer for Naval Mobile Construction Battalion Detachment Guam They re working through the changing weather conditions \u2014 it rains two or three times a day and is very hot and humid the rest of the time \u2014 on top of learning a brand new tent system that most of our guys haven t seen before But the team learned quickly and hasn t let anything get in the way of completing the EMF on time These guys are awesome With more than Seabees working to build the facility construction began April with the grading and leveling of the five acre site Precise leveling and ground compaction is vital due to the sensitive nature of the medical equipment We started by knocking the ground down to a less than percent slope Harms said then built it back up while compacting the ground to make sure it was flat and stable for the facility Following ground preparation the team began construction of the facility s infrastructure April The combined crew of NMCB and NMCB started going through and building up the tents into different wings that will make up the medical core Harms said There are also support sites that are being built up for the EMF including fuel and water farms a troop berthing and hygiene area and a galley All of those are part of the expeditionary medical facility and are required to support the approximately medical and support personnel that are coming in The Seabees were able to work as a cohesive unit due to the technical guidance provided by sailors on the Expeditionary

wiegen \u2013 hier die Variante des Ausbildungsleiters Beurteilung von Gel\u00e4ndeabschnitten Nach einer kurzen theoretischen Einweisung erfolgte die Einteilung in Zweiertrupps Anschlie\u00dfend wurden die Mann Trupss in Bewegung gesetzt Die erste Station befand sich auf einer nahe Arnstein gelegenen Kuppe Von hier oben offenbarte sich den Teilnehmern ein weiter Blick \u00fcber die Stadt und die angrenzenden W\u00e4lder und Fluren Das Gel\u00e4nde kann je nach Lage Vor oder Nachteile mit sich bringen Die schnelle und sichere Beurteilung des Gel\u00e4ndes ist deshalb eine essentielle Fertigkeit des Scouts Dazu geh\u00f6rt das pr\u00e4zise Ansprechen besonderer Gel\u00e4ndepunkte Dies gelingt effektiv nur unter Verwendung einheitlicher Angaben und Begriffe W\u00e4hrend das spezifische Vokabular schnell erlernt werden kann ben\u00f6tigt das Absch\u00e4tzen von Entfernungen deutlich mehr \u00dcbung Hierbei kamen die Vorteile des Zweiertrupps erstmals zum Tragen Die Mittelwerte der Sch\u00e4tzungen lieferten meist bessere Ergebnisse als die Einzelwerte Zwischen den verschiedenen Ausbildungsabschnitten wurde das Gel\u00e4nde stets neu beurteilt Je nach Situation war beispielsweise zu pr\u00fcfen welche Sicht das Gel\u00e4nde bietet oder wo man Deckung und Tarnschutz findet Das Gebiet rund um Arnstein ist wie die allermeisten Teile Deutschlands eine dauerhaft vom Menschen gepr\u00e4gte Landschaft Wo heute noch hoher Mais Sichtschutz bietet kann morgen bereits ein abgeerntetes Feld die bisherige Route unbrauchbar machen Einzig der Wald bietet zuverl\u00e4ssigen Schutz gegen unerw\u00fcnschte Beobachter Der Wald erschwert jedoch das Vorankommen und ist in vielen Regionen nur noch sp\u00e4rlich vorhanden Beinhaltet der Ernstfall eine Bedrohung durch Waffenwirkung sollte man sich ohnehin m\u00f6glichst nur im Schutz der Dunkelheit bewegen Der Autor an einer Ausbildungsstation \u2013 das Zeichnen von verschiedenen Skizzentypen z\u00e4hlt zum Einmaleins der Lehrgangsinhalte Orientierung mit Karten und Skizzen Zu Beginn des Kurses erhielten die Teilnehmer eine amtliche topographische Karte der Region im Ma\u00dfstab ATK25 einen Bleistift und einen wasserfesten Notizblock im Taschenformat Der Detailreichtum des Kartenmaterials ist bemerkenswert Sogar Trampelpfade und einzelne Baumreihen sind verzeichnet Eine Karte ersetzt zwar niemals den Blick ins Gel\u00e4nde ist aber f\u00fcr eine detaillierte Routenplanung unerl\u00e4sslich Es besteht jedoch nicht immer die M\u00f6glichkeit eine Karte mit sich zu f\u00fchren Deshalb kann es erforderlich sein eine Wegeskizze anzufertigen Eine gute Skizze stellt das Wesentliche einfach \u00fcbersichtlich und deutlich dar Hierf\u00fcr wird zuerst der passende Kartenausschnitt gew\u00e4hlt Anschlie\u00dfend werden die relevanten Informationen auf den Notizblock \u00fcbertragen Dabei ist sicherzustellen dass alle Abzweigungen auf der Bewegungslinie gekennzeichnet sind Zus\u00e4tzlich kann die Skizze durch markante Punkte oder Gel\u00e4ndeeigenschaften erg\u00e4nzt werden Durch die Angabe von Entfernungen und der Himmelsrichtung wird die Skizze vervollst\u00e4ndigt Die Qualit\u00e4t der Skizzen lie\u00df sich leicht \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen indem diese als einzige Orientierungshilfe auf dem Weg zur jeweils n\u00e4chsten Station verwendet wurden Teil der Ausbildung ist das Erstellen weiterer Skizzenarten wie z B der Ansichtsskizze oder der Sichtmarkentafel Zeichnerisches Talent ist von Vorteil aber \u00dcbung macht den Meister Im Verlauf des Lehrgangs wurden zahlreiche Skizzen erstellt Der Entwicklungsfortschritt lie\u00df sich beim Vergleich der ersten Versuche mit den letzten Aufzeichnungen unschwer erkennen Alle wichtigen Gel\u00e4ndemerkmale eines solchen Ausblicks in eine Skizze zu packen und nur die wesentlichen Informationen festzuhalten ist f\u00fcr viele eine Herausforderung Bewegung und Entfaltung Die Streckenabschnitte zwischen den jeweiligen Ausbildungsstationen wurden genutzt um verschiedene Bewegungsformen kennenzulernen Die Formation \u201eReihe\u201c z\u00e4hlt zu den tiefen Bewegungsformen und wird auf herk\u00f6mmlichen Wegen eingenommen Sie bildet sich hinter dem Gruppenf\u00fchrer oder dem in der befohlenen Marschrichtung vorangehenden Zweiertrupp Die Abst\u00e4nde und Zwischenr\u00e4ume sind nicht fest vorgegeben sondern werden der Lage dem Gel\u00e4nde und der Sicht entsprechend angepasst W\u00e4hrend dem Marsch wurde immer wieder Blickkontakt zum Gruppenf\u00fchrer hergestellt da die Kommunikation vorwiegend \u00fcber Handzeichen erfolgte Mit erhobener Hand wurde Verbindung aufgenommen und das Signal von Trupp zu Trupp weitergeleitet Somit war sichergestellt dass auch Teile der Gruppe ohne direkten Sichtkontakt zum Gruppenf\u00fchrer s\u00e4mtliche Anweisungen erhielten Die Ausbilder verzichteten auf unn\u00f6tige Zeichensprache Zahlreiche aus dem Milit\u00e4r bekannte Handzeichen wurden durch schlichtes Vor und Nachmachen ersetzt was erstaunlich gut funktionierte Die breite Bewegungsform \u201eRudel\u201c eignet sich vor allem f\u00fcr un\u00fcbersichtliches Gel\u00e4nde Die Zweiertrupps entfalten sich dabei links und rechts vom Gruppenf\u00fchrer und warten auf den Marschbefehl Diese Formation eignet sich auch zur \u00dcberquerung von Stra\u00dfen welche die Bewegungslinie kreuzen Von der Seite her gesehen l\u00e4sst sie keinen R\u00fcckschluss auf die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der Gruppe zu Die eigentliche \u00dcberquerung der Sprung dauert nur einen kurzen Moment F\u00fcr jede Bewegung gilt analog zum milit\u00e4rischen Prinzip \u201eFeuer und Bewegung\u201c die Routine \u201e\u00fcberwachen und bewegen\u201c So wird sichergestellt dass sich kein Trupp bewegt ohne dass ein anderer Trupp die Umgebung nach m\u00f6glichen Bedrohungen absucht Nur so ist es m\u00f6glich sich jeglicher Beobachtung und Waffenwirkung zu entziehen um unverletzt zum Ziel zu gelangen Durch die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der Ausbildungsgruppe der Autor besuchte einen Kurs mit Teilnehmern entsteht eine positiv motivierende Gruppendynamik die durch Gesamtzusammenhalt und das intensive Arbeiten im Mann Trupp gepr\u00e4gt wird Nachtlager und Sp\u00e4htrupp Am fr\u00fchen Abend erreichte die Gruppe die letzte Station des Tages Von au\u00dfen nicht einsehbar befand sich auf einer bewaldeten Anh\u00f6he eine Lichtung Ein geeigneter Ort f\u00fcr das Nachtlager Auf der Suche nach einem gem\u00fctlichen Schlafplatz bot sich die Wahl zwischen Ameisenhaufen und Dornengestr\u00fcpp Letzteres stellte sich als das geringere \u00dcbel heraus da sich die aggressiven Bewohner der Lichtung wenig erfreut \u00fcber uns Eindringlinge zeigten und nach kurzer Zeit zum Angriff \u00fcbergingen Nachdem jeder Gelegenheit hatte sich einzurichten und eine St\u00e4rkung zu sich zu nehmen versammelte sich die Gruppe bei Einbruch der Dunkelheit vor dem Lagerplatz Es folgte die Einweisung in den Sp\u00e4htrupp Ein Sp\u00e4htrupp ist leicht ausger\u00fcstet soll viel sehen und h\u00f6ren und nicht erkannt werden Als vorbereitende Ma\u00dfnahmen wurden deshalb alle gl\u00e4nzenden oder reflektierenden Gegenst\u00e4nde vom Mann entfernt ebenso alle Schriftst\u00fccke Aufzeichnungen und Skizzen welche \u00fcber die Verbindungen oder den Lagerort der Gruppe Auskunft geben k\u00f6nnten Parat gemacht wurden das \u00dcberlebenspaket Regenschutz sowie gen\u00fcgend Trinkwasser f\u00fcr den Notfall Das Ziel des Unternehmens war die Informationsgewinnung \u00fcber ein ca Kilometer entferntes Objekt Zur Planung geh\u00f6rte der Blick ins Gel\u00e4nde ebenso wie das Studieren von Karten und Skizzen Nachdem die Bewegungslinie Sammelpunkte und Erkennungszeichen festgelegt wurden gab der Sp\u00e4htruppf\u00fchrer das Signal f\u00fcr den Einsatz Von nun an wurde nur noch durch Zeichen oder Beispiel gef\u00fchrt Der Sp\u00e4htrupp arbeitete sich vorsichtig und unauff\u00e4llig an das Zielobjekt heran Am Beobachtungspunkt angelangt wurden die Ohren gespitzt In der Dunkelheit traten aus der Stille selbst leise Ger\u00e4usche klar und deutlich hervor Der Wind trug Stimmen einer Unterhaltung herbei welche den Blicken jedoch verborgen blieb Auf einen Schlag setzte aus der Ferne ein donnerndes Grollen ein gefolgt von heftigem Geknatter Granatwerfer und Maschinengewehrfeuer wechselten sich gegenseitig ab Das Nachtschiessen auf dem ca Kilometer entfernt gelegenen Truppen\u00fcbungsplatz Hammelburg trug zur Atmosph\u00e4re dieser n\u00e4chtlichen \u00dcbungsmission bei Die Pr\u00fcfung Ein lauter Pfiff beendete die Nachtruhe Kurze Zeit sp\u00e4ter versammelten sich alle Teilnehmer vor dem Lager und erhielten die Instruktionen f\u00fcr die Abschlusspr\u00fcfung Die Pr\u00fcfung bestand aus zwei Teilen Erstellen einer Wegeskizze vom Lagerort zur\u00fcck zum Ausgangspunkt des Lehrgangs der Burg Arnstein Erreichen der Burg innerhalb von Minuten Marschleistung ca km Die Pr\u00fcfung wurde im mittlerweile eingespielten Zweiertrupp absolviert Der Autor und sein Kamerad einigten sich schnell auf die wichtigsten Kriterien Die Bewegungslinie sollte ausreichend Sichtschutz bieten damit wir m\u00f6glichst unauff\u00e4llig zum Ziel gelangen Kr\u00e4ftezehrende H\u00f6henwechsel sollten vermieden werden damit das Ziel in der vorgegebenen Zeit erreicht werden konnte Die Wahl fiel letztlich auf eine parallel zu einem Bach verlaufende Bewegungslinie welche durch verschiedene Waldst\u00fccke bis nach Arnstein f\u00fchrte Es blieben nur wenige Minuten um die Skizze zu erstellen bevor das Kartenmaterial abgegeben und der Rucksack ein letztes Mal geschultert wurde Im Eilmarsch erreichten wir nach knapp einer Stunde die Burg Dort warteten bereits einige ersch\u00f6pft aber zufrieden dreinblickende Gesichter Die Pr\u00fcfung war bestanden der Lehrgang erfolgreich absolviert Fazit Die im Lehrgang SCOUT II erworbenen Fertigkeiten erm\u00f6glichen den Teilnehmern in Krisensituationen handlungsf\u00e4hig zu bleiben \u2013 und zwar weitestgehend ohne technische Hilfsmittel Teamgeist und Hilfsbereitschaft pr\u00e4gten die besondere Atmosph\u00e4re dieses Lehrgangs Sowohl die professionelle Kursorganisation als auch der gut durchdachte inhaltliche Aufbau sorgten von Anfang bis Ende f\u00fcr eine steile Lernkurve Die Ausbilder verf\u00fcgen \u00fcber enormes Fachwissen und gew\u00e4hrleisteten \u00fcber die gesamte Kursdauer einen kontinuierlichen Informationstransfer Dies erforderte von den Teilnehmern ein hohes Ma\u00df an Konzentration Auch die k\u00f6rperliche Belastbarkeit wurde auf die Probe gestellt denn nur wer au\u00dferhalb der eigenen Komfortzone trainiert ist f\u00fcr den Ernstfall gewappnet Service Der n\u00e4chste Lehrgang SCOUT II findet am Juli statt Das Seminar SCOUT I ist Teilnahmevoraussetzung und findet mindestens einmal im Quartal statt

computing \u2013 has taken an interesting tack While GPUs becoming more widely used as general purpose accelerators was widely predicted and has landed on target in a big way how we got here has been an interesting path CPU progression has sputtered parallel architectures and whole companies have risen and fallen the world\u2019s most powerful supercomputers now include GPUs as the core of their computational throughput and no one saw the deep learning revolution coming until it was already upon us Standing over this landscape for most of that last decade and a half as been OpenCL Khronos\u2019s open framework for programming GPUs and other compute accelerators Originally birthed by Apple and broadly adopted by the industry as a whole OpenCL was the first and still most coherent effort to create a common API for parallel programming By taking lessons from the early vendor proprietary efforts and assembling a broader standard that everyone could use OpenCL has been adopted for everything from embedded processors and DSPs up to GPUs that push half a kilowatt in power consumption On the whole OpenCL has been broadly successful in meeting the framework\u2019s goals for a common and largely portable compute programming platform It\u2019s not just supported on a wide range of hardware but it\u2019s incredibly relevant even to current events it\u2019s the accelerator API being used by the Folding Home project the world\u2019s most powerful computing cluster which is being intensively used to research treatment options for the COVID pandemic At the same time however just as how no one could quite predict the evolution of the parallel computing market things haven\u2019t always gone quite according to plan for Khronos and the OpenCL working group that spearheads its development As we\u2019ve touched upon a few times over the past year in various articles OpenCL is in something of a precarious state on the PC desktop its original home Over a decade since its inception the GPU computing ecosystem is fracturing NVIDIA\u2019s interest is tempered by the fact that they already have their very successful CUDA API AMD\u2019s OpenCL drivers are a mess Apple has deprecated OpenCL and is moving to its own proprietary Metal API The only vendor who seems to have a real interest in OpenCL at this time is strangely enough Intel Meanwhile OpenCL was never wildly adopted in mobile devices despite its patchy use and the fact that these are getting ever more powerful GPUs and other parallel processing blocks So today Khronos is doing something for which I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s any parallel for in the computing industry \u2013 and certainly there\u2019s never been anything like it in the GPU computing ecosystem the framework is taking a large step backwards Looking to reset the ecosystem as the group likes to call it today Khronos is revealing OpenCL the latest version of their compute API Taking some hard earned and hard learned lessons to heart the group is turning back the clock on OpenCL reverting the core API to a fork of OpenCL As a result everything developed as part of OpenCL x has now become optional vendors can and generally will continue to support those features but those features are no longer required for compliance with the core specification Instead of having to support every OpenCL feature no matter how useful or useless it might be for a given platform the future of the API is going to be around vendors choosing which optional features they\u2019d like to support on top of the core OpenCL derrived specification Politics Taking Licks Overall the OpenCL announcement brings a lot to unpack But perhaps the best place to start is understanding the OpenCL development process and who OpenCL\u2019s users are Khronos as a reminder is an industry consortium The organization itself has no real power \u2013 it\u2019s just a collection of companies \u2013 and because it\u2019s not a platform holder like Microsoft or Apple the group can\u2019t force technological change on anyone Instead the strength of Khronos\u2019s efforts is that it gets broad industry support for its standards incorporating the experience and concerns of many vendors across the ecosystem The challenge in a collaborative approach however is that it requires at least a certain degree of harmony and agreement among the companies taking part If no agreement can be reached on what to do next then a project cannot move forward Or if no one is happy with the resulting product then a product may be skipped entirely Setting industry standards is ultimately a political matter even if it\u2019s for a technology standard This is in a way the problem OpenCL has run into The most recent version of the specification OpenCL was released back in Critically it introduced the OpenCL C kernel language finally bringing support for a more modern object oriented language to an API that was originally based on C Equally critical however three years later no one has adopted OpenCL Not NVIDIA not AMD not Intel and certainly not any embedded device manufacturer For as important a step forward as OpenCL was and before it the fact of the matter is that no one ended up particularly happy with the state of OpenCL after As a result it\u2019s been losing relevance and is no longer fulfilling the goals of the project The OpenCL project tried to please everyone with x and instead it ended up pleasing no one OpenCL Going Forwards by Going Backwards So if OpenCL x has largely been ignored what\u2019s the solution to making OpenCL relevant once again For Khronos and the OpenCL working group the answer is to go back to what worked And what worked best was OpenCL First introduced back in OpenCL was the last of the OpenCL x releases By modern API standards it\u2019s very barebones it\u2019s based on pure C and lacking support for things like shared virtual memory or the SPIR V intermediate representation language But at the same time it\u2019s also the last version of the API that doesn\u2019t include a bunch of cruft that someone somewhere doesn\u2019t want It\u2019s a pure fairly low level parallel computing API for developers across the spectrum from embedded devices to the beefiest of GPUs Ultimately what the OpenCL working group has been able to agree on is that OpenCL should be the core of a new specification \u2013 that anything else released after it no matter how useful in some cases isn\u2019t useful enough that it should be required in all implementations And so for OpenCL this is exactly what\u2019s happening The newest version of OpenCL is inheriting and making it the new core specification while all other features beyond that are being moved out of the core specification and being made optional It\u2019s this reset that Khronos and the working group is intending to give OpenCL a new path forward Despite turning back the clock by almost nine years OpenCL is nowhere close to being done evolving But its previous rigid monolithic nature also kept it from evolving because there was only one path forward If a vendor was happy with OpenCL but wanted a couple of extra features for example then to be compliant with the specification they\u2019d need to implement the entire core specification OpenCL x x had no mechanism for partial compliance It was all or nothing and a number of vendors chose \u201cnothing \u201d OpenCL by contrast is specifically structured in a way to let vendors use the parts they need and only those parts As previously mentioned the actual core of the specification is essentially OpenCL with the addition feature query support as well as some \u201cminor entry points for improved app portability \u201d Layered on top of that in turn is everything else all of OpenCL x\u2019s features as well as OpenCL \u2019s new features All of these additional features are optional allowing platform vendors to pick and choose what additional features they\u2019d like to support if any at all For example an embedded vendor may stick very close to what was OpenCL and then adopt a couple of features like asynchronous DMA extensions and shared virtual memory Meanwhile a large green discrete GPU developer may adopt most of OpenCL x but exclude support for that shared virtual memory which isn\u2019t very useful for a discrete accelerator And then a third vendor in the middle might want to adopt on device dispatch but not SPIR V Ultimately OpenCL gives platform vendors the ability to select those features they need in essence tailoring OpenCL to their specific desires This as it turns out is very similar to how Khronos has tackled Vulkan which has been far more successful in recent years Giving vendors some flexibility in what their API implements has allowed Vulkan to be stretched from mobile devices to the desktop so there is some very clear real world evidence that this structure can work And it\u2019s this kind of success that the OpenCL working group would like to see as well Ultimately as Khronos sees it OpenCL\u2019s struggles over the last half decade or so have come from trying to make it everything for everyone while at the same time keeping its monolithic nature What the embedded guys need is different from the CPU APU guys and what those guys need is different still from the dGPU guys \u2013 and we still haven\u2019t gotten to things like FPGAs and more esoteric uses of OpenCL So in order to secure its own future OpenCL needs to move away from being a monolithic design and instead being adaptable to the wide range of devices and markets the framework is designed to serve Walking the Path Forward Diving just a bit deeper let\u2019s take a quick look at what OpenCL means for developers platform vendors and users as far as software development and compatibility are concerned Despite the significant change in development philosophy OpenCL is designed to be as backwards compatible as is reasonable For developers and users because the core specification is based on OpenCL applications will run unchanged on any OpenCL device Meanwhile for OpenCL x applications those applications will also run unchanged on OpenCL devices as well so long as those devices support whatever x features were being used Which to be sure doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to be running an OpenCL application on an embedded system any time soon but on PCs and other systems where OpenCL applications already run they aren\u2019t expected to stop running under OpenCL The reason for that distinction again comes to down to the optional inclusion of features Platform vendors developing an OpenCL runtime don\u2019t need to support x features but they also don\u2019t need to drop them they can continue to support optional features as they see fit In fact the new specification requires relatively little of platform holders as far as core compliance is concerned OpenCL and x drivers do need some changes to meet x compliance but this is mainly around supporting OpenCL\u2019s new feature queries So vendors will be able to release drivers in short order Going forward then the focus is going to be on application developers making proper use of feature queries Because OpenCL x features are optional all applications using x optional features are strongly encouraged to use feature queries to first make sure the necessary features are available at a minimum an application can then fail gracefully rather than a harder failure from invoking a feature that doesn\u2019t exist So while OpenCL x software will continue to work as is developers are being encouraged to update their applications to run feature queries Now with all of that said it should be noted that since a bunch of previously required OpenCL x features have been made optional this does mean that platform vendors are allowed to drop them if they wish Talking to Khronos it doesn\u2019t sound like this is going to happen \u2013 at least not with the PC hardware vendors \u2013 but it\u2019s an option none the less and one that they acknowledge Where it\u2019s more likely to be seen if anywhere would be the embedded space and such where vendors were already dragging their heels on features like SPIR V Finally while the real world impact of this will be nil it\u2019s also worth noting that because OpenCL was never adopted the OpenCL standard does technically leave something behind OpenCL C which was introduced in has not been included in the OpenCL specification even as an optional feature Instead the OpenCL working group is discarding it entirely Replacing OpenCL C is the C for OpenCL project which despite the naming similarities is a separate project entirely The differences are fairly small from a programming perspective but essentially C for OpenCL is being built with a layered approach In this case using Clang LLVM to compile the code down to SPIR V which then can be run on the lower levels of the OpenCL execution stack like other code And of course Khronos\u2019s SYCL remains as well to provide single source C programming for parallel compute SYCL it should be noted is based on top of OpenCL so it makes this transition rather unfazed What\u2019s New in OpenCL Asynchronous DMA Extensions SPIR V Besides the major reversion to the core specification OpenCL does also include some new optional features for platform vendors and developers to dig their teeth into Chief among these are Asynchronous DMA extensions which will end up being a particularly tasty carrot for platform vendors whom have been sticking with OpenCL so far Intended to expose direct memory access operations in OpenCL for devices that have DMA hardware Asynchronous DMA is exactly what the name says on the tin support for executing DMA transfers asynchronously This allows DMA transactions to be run concurrently with compute kernels as opposed to synchronous operations which generally can only be executed between other compute kernel operations This includes being able to run multiple DMA operations concurrent to each other as well This feature is particularly notable for enabling 2D and 3D memory transfers \u2013 that is complex memory structures that are more advanced than simple 1D linear memory structures As you might expect this is intended to be useful for images and similar data which are inherently 2D 3D structures to begin with Meanwhile OpenCL also introduces SPIR V support to OpenCL This again is an optional feature for platform holders and brings OpenCL slightly more up to date in its SPIR V support with mainline SPIR V now at version Truth be told I\u2019m not sure how relevant the option of support is going to be at the moment however because it\u2019s part of the Vulkan specification \u2013 and indeed a lot of the advances in it over are focused on graphics \u2013 it\u2019s going to play a bigger role going forward in reinforcing interoperability between Vulkan and OpenCL What\u2019s Next for OpenCL Finally as part of OpenCL\u2019s major overhaul for Khronos and the OpenCL working group is also laying out their plans for the future development of OpenCL By clearing the board and moving so many features to optional it gives the working group new freedom to add to OpenCL as the user base sees fit And following their new philosophy in a more piecemeal way A big part as always will be the continued evolution of the OpenCL core specification While winds things back the plan isn\u2019t to maintain the eque core specification forever Rather like other Khronos projects the goal of the working group is still to move widely adopted and well tested extensions into the core To once again add additional layers to the onion as it were but in a much smarter and measured fashion than was OpenCL x development In the meantime one of the high priority features for future versions will be what the group is calling Flexible Profile which is another embedded focused feature Interestingly in some respects this is an even more stripped down version of OpenCL allowing vendors to excise even more features to specifically match what their hardware can do For example floating point precision modes like IEEE single precision which are normally required in OpenCL could be removed as well as some API calls Besides further simplifying things for some developers it would make OpenCL a better fit for environments with rigorous safety certification requirements think automotive as a smaller OpenCL feature set would be much easier to validate and get certified Meanwhile at the other end of the spectrum Khronos is once again looking at the idea of feature sets for OpenCL to help software developers better navigate the differences between major platforms While the option heavy nature of OpenCL makes it relatively fine grained it also hurts portability to a degree \u2013 a developer can\u2019t count on another OpenCL implementation to necessary have anything more than what the eqsue core specification calls for So not unlike graphics feature sets for GPUs OpenCL feature sets would allow the industry to engage in some standardization \u2013 say a PC profile with numerous modern features and then a machine learning profile with support for a smaller number of features more relevant to just deep learning operations The group is also looking at continued opportunities for layered approaches where OpenCL support isn\u2019t and likely never will be a native part of the platform This is another concept taken from the Vulkan playbook where there are layers available to run Vulkan on platforms like Apple\u2019s Metal OpenCL already has an active project to run on top of Vulkan \u2013 clspv and clvk \u2013 which has been used in mobile to help Adobe port and reuse its OpenCL code from deskto0p Premiere over to Premiere Rush without requiring an extensive rewrite Meanwhile Microsoft has been backing an OpenCL project as well Open CLOn12 which will implement OpenCL support on top of DirectX But the big layering question that Khronos is posing right now revolves around OpenCL for Apple\u2019s platforms The original author of OpenCL hasn\u2019t made it any farther than supporting OpenCL and they\u2019ve marked the feature for deprecation So if OpenCL is going to stay working on Apple platforms \u2013 never mind supporting new x and x features \u2013 then new support would need to be added as a higher level layer So while there isn\u2019t currently a OpenCL over Metal project it seems like it\u2019s only a matter of time until one is started if of course Khronos can find enough interested parties for the project The group has seen a lot of success with MoltenVK their Vulkan over Metal layer so an OpenCL project would fit in well with that Finally even Vulkan itself is a potential project of sorts for the OpenCL working group The reversions to the core specification mean that Vulkan OpenCL interoperability have taken a step back and the working group would like to push that forward Ideally OpenCL should be able to work within the same memory set as Vulkan as well as import and export semaphores all in an explicit fashion OpenCL Provisional Today Formalization In A Few Months But before any of this can formally happen Khronos and the OpenCL working group will have their work cut out for them getting OpenCL out the door While the group is introducing OpenCL today the standard is still provisional \u2013 it\u2019s being revealed to developers and the wider public to get feedback ahead of full formalization And given the currently sputtering state of OpenCL x the group is eager to get OpenCL finalized sooner than later All told Khronos hopes that they\u2019ll be able to get ratification for the standard in a few months Along with getting member and developer buy in finalization will also require that the OpenCL conformance tests which are also already in development are completed so that the group can formally approve OpenCL implementations Being the technical part this may end up being the easier task with the OpenCL core specification unwinding so many features and adding so little in return vendors who already have solid OpenCL implementations shouldn\u2019t have too much trouble getting their OpenCL drivers

NSA Titled Lost in Translation the dispatch was best known for publishing the Eternal Blue exploit that would later power the WannaCry and NotPetya worms that caused tens of billions of dollars worth

group went to great lengths to infect and surveil its targets For instance spearphishing emails were prepared separately for each target to ensure they grabbed recipients attention and induced them to open an attached Microsoft document Additionally the full featured malware was developed from scratch and evolved considerably over the eight year span of the group s known existence Each malware sample was compiled immediately before being sent to include the latest available version of the executable The attackers were resourceful and kept updating their malware during the full life cycle of their operations so the observed samples from are totally different from the initial ones from Kaspersky researchers wrote in a post published on Tuesday The suspension of its operations may be related to the publishing of the Lost in Translation leak or the attackers may simply have decided to switch to more modern approaches and start using more widely available artefacts for their operations DarkUniverse s modular malware was capable of collecting a wide range of information about the user and the infected system over an extended period of time Data collected included Keyboard input Email conversations Credentials from Outlook Express Outlook Internet Explorer Windows Mail and Windows Live Mail Windows Live Messenger and the Internet Cache Screenshots Files from specific

researchers Phil Akers and Bob Reese scans computer networks to identify all of its devices installed programs and services and makes a map of them on a screen Akers and Reese have been customizing Netmapper to scan the complex networks of the U S military so that government entities can use it to simulate cyberattacks and test out their defenses Circadence Corporation a cyber readiness company that has an office in Tupelo contracted Netmapper for the project in Reese said he believes the program will get official permission in the next six months to be used on any military base nationwide Reese and CCI Director Drew Hamilton both said it\u2019s unusual for a piece of university created software to be considered for use by the U S Department of Defense \u201cTrying to determine what\u2019s on a network and to do network planning is a huge problem so I think this is a major contribution that we\u2019re looking at making from MSU \u201d Hamilton said In Reese and Akers took over responsibility for the creation of automation tools that can replicate a network and simulate cyberattacks because \u201cother groups could never deliver something that was working \u201d Reese said Netmapper creates a visual display of how every device in a network is linked what kinds of devices and programs are in the network and how the links between them have changed over time It also duplicates the settings from a real computer network into a simulated environment so programmers do not have to build one from scratch Reese said The Army\u2019s Threat Systems Management Office works with Circadence to create simulated computer networks and has been funding the collaboration between Circadence and MSU for seven years Mississippi\u2019s congressional delegation directed the first year of funding to TSMO specifically for academic and economic development in Mississippi Reese said and the project has performed well enough for the funding to be renewed every year TSMO is a cyber range or \u201ca collection of people and computers that are used to simulate computer networks \u201d Reese said If other cyber ranges adopt Netmapper as a defense tool the developers will receive funding from sources outside Congress he said Circadence would like to develop Netmapper as a commercial tool but the research team is focusing on \u201ctrying to make government users happy\u201d right now Reese said Akers described the project as \u201cfascinating\u201d to work on especially since he and Reese are primarily electrical engineers and had not considered computer networks to be

social distancing should consider the cost paid in human lives | Matt Beard", "text": "A t a press conference last week the chief medical officer Brendan Murphy introduced the latest in a slew of national metaphors After \u201cTeam Australia\u201d and \u201cFortress Australia\u201d we now have \u201cLifeboat Australia\u201d \u201cWe have put ourselves on a life raft \u201d Murphy said of the effectiveness of current coronavirus containment measures Now \u201cwe have to chart the course of where we take that life raft\u201d One direction receiving growing support is to direct the raft towards a return to life as we knew it No sooner had we gotten our heads around the new distancing rules had some begun to suggest that it was time to think about winding them back \u2013 or winding them up Even the prime minister Scott Morrison has been clear in saying these measures cannot last forever Economically something must give or we\u2019re going to set ourselves and future generations up for a whole lot of suffering down the line \u2013 at least that\u2019s the argument though whether it\u2019s true is a matter of some debate But setting aside the economic questions it seems as though the real question for Lifeboat Australia may not be what direction it heads in but how long we\u2019re willing to float before we start to kick people out and leave them at sea What brings the moral and ethical nature of the choices before our leaders isn\u2019t the question of where we go but the brutal indigestible fact that not everyone is getting out of this alive Indeed Lifeboat Australia isn\u2019t the first ship to have to consider these questions In there was another yacht \u2013 the Mignonette \u2013 making its way to our shores It shipwrecked with a crew of four More than a week passed and rations ran out It was becoming clear that not all of the crew were going to make it out alive They discussed drawing lots to see who would be sacrificed so the others might live Situations like these are known in ethics circles as \u201clifeboat dilemmas\u201d In these cases there are no good options either everyone suffers or the group will try to find defensible reasons for sacrificing some people for the good of others The question is who most deserves to survive or \u2013 to put it another way \u2013 who do we have the best reasons to let die In the past philosophers have relied too heavily on neutral abstract assessment to resolve ethical trade offs As tempting as it is to reduce the discussion around exit strategies for our current containment measures as a simple ethical dilemma the truth is far more complicated The lifeboat dilemma assumes we\u2019re trading lives for lives \u2013 that is things of equivalent value The approach to rolling back distancing rules is far more complex This choice pits life against life quality of life against quantity wellbeing against survival As the Australian philosopher Peter Singer argued \u201cI think the assumption and it has been an assumption in this discussion that we have to do everything to reduce the number of deaths is not really the right assumption \u2026 How do we assess the overall cost to everybody in terms of loss of quality of life loss of well being as well as the fact that lives are being lost \u201d Singer rightly makes the point that we are willing to trade loss of life for quality of life in a range of different social contexts For example we permit the sale of alcohol knowing it will be implicated in a range of deaths from overuse drunk driving domestic violence and other causes We should take a moment to confront this reality head on We frequently trade lives for social or economic comfort The seemingly impossible trade offs involved in rolling back distancing rules is actually quite familiar What\u2019s less familiar is that we\u2019re aware of the victims of this trade off \u2013 they usually remain invisible or abstract to us For example in New South Wales rates of family violence increase on State of Origin day but few are aware of these victims It\u2019s much harder to claim that we\u2019re OK with a few more people dying if it means we get our NRL fix when it comes to Covid It\u2019s not possible to be ignorant of the risks We\u2019ve spent the last months desperately upending our way of life to keep people safe And now as the costs for us increasingly pile up and we consider when we\u2019re being asked to pay too high a price for that safety we can\u2019t easily put the vulnerable Australians with whom we\u2019ve stood in solidarity out of our minds That\u2019s a good thing At whatever point we decide to ease social distancing we need to remember there will be a significant group of people who will bear the consequences of that choice Whether though illness death and the grief of losing loved ones or through loss of work and income mental health crises loneliness and isolation increased exposure to domestic violence self harm or death not everyone is going to be staying on Lifeboat Australia When we steer through this \u2013 eventually \u2013 we will owe it to those victims And we will owe it to them that we do whatever we can to minimise their suffering and bear witness to the inescapable remainder Theirs will be a sacrifice in which they have no say nor deserve to have to pay Moreover we should be ashamed that in \u201cordinary times\u201d we remain blissfully unaware of those who suffer so that we might flourish It\u2019s easy to turn our mind away from those whose lands were stolen from them by colonialism who were enslaved to build a legacy we enjoy whose unacknowledged domestic labour props up our entire system whose habitats and species have been destroyed or pushed to the verge of collapse And yet as Singer notes we make those choices comfortably every day without hearing from the victims This should worry us deeply Silence is an excellent way of ensuring victims remain that way Without hearing their objections their perspectives and their testimony it\u2019s easy to convince ourselves that we\u2019ve made a clear headed assessment of how to manage a tricky trade off Many of those calling for a fast end to distancing measures don\u2019t talk in much detail about the costs paid in human lives We can\u2019t pretend this is a thought experiment the people who are sacrificed here aren\u2019t abstractions They\u2019re the grandparents who won\u2019t see their grandkids\u2019 next birthday the chronically ill woman who won\u2019t get to walk down the aisle the chemotherapy patient who won\u2019t get to hear that his cancer is in recession These people deserve a voice in and a vote on what is to come In the past philosophers have relied too heavily on neutral abstract assessment to resolve ethical trade offs We\u2019ve convinced ourselves that cool detached reason can help us determine how to balance loss of life and quality of life to determine whose lives matter most and what kinds of lives are worth living We should know better today how quickly that kind of thinking becomes self serving When I\u2019ve presented lifeboat dilemmas to students few have considered the possibility that they\u2019d be the ones to die It\u2019s elderly disabled and infirm people who tend to be first in line \u2013 and they\u2019re usually not part of the discussion It\u2019s perhaps not a coincidence that the person who ended up being sacrificed on the Mignonette was the cabin boy Richard Parker who had drunk seawater and fallen ill He was murdered after the captain and first mate decided he didn\u2019t stand a chance at survival and that he was therefore the best candidate to be sacrificed Nobody asked Parker what he thought",

artificial general intelligence or AGI will finally arrive It\u2019s mostly seen as a fun way to bond and their estimates differ widely But in a field that still debates whether human like autonomous systems are even possible half the lab bets it is likely to happen within years In the four short years of its existence OpenAI has become one of the leading AI research labs in the world It has made a name for itself producing consistently headline grabbing research alongside other AI heavyweights like Alphabet\u2019s DeepMind It is also a darling in Silicon Valley counting Elon Musk and legendary investor Sam Altman among its founders Above all it is lionized for its mission Its goal is to be the first to create AGI\u2014a machine with the learning and reasoning powers of a human mind The purpose is not world domination rather the lab wants to ensure that the technology is developed safely and its benefits distributed evenly to the world The implication is that AGI could easily run amok if the technology\u2019s development is left to follow the path of least resistance Narrow intelligence the kind of clumsy AI that surrounds us today has already served as an example We now know that algorithms are biased and fragile they can perpetrate great abuse and great deception and the expense of developing and running them tends to concentrate their power in the hands of a few By extrapolation AGI could be catastrophic without the careful guidance of a benevolent shepherd OpenAI wants to be that shepherd and it has carefully crafted its image to fit the bill In a field dominated by wealthy corporations it was founded as a nonprofit Its first announcement said that this distinction would allow it to \u201cbuild value for everyone rather than shareholders \u201d Its charter \u2014a document so sacred that employees\u2019 pay is tied to how well they adhere to it\u2014further declares that OpenAI\u2019s \u201cprimary fiduciary duty is to humanity \u201d Attaining AGI safely is so important it continues that if another organization were close to getting there first OpenAI would stop competing with it and collaborate instead This alluring narrative plays well with investors and the media and in July Microsoft injected the lab with a fresh billion OpenAI s logo hanging in its office Christie Hemm Klok But three days at OpenAI\u2019s office\u2014and nearly three dozen interviews with past and current employees collaborators friends and other experts in the field\u2014suggest a different picture There is a misalignment between what the company publicly espouses and how it operates behind closed doors Over time it has allowed a fierce competitiveness and mounting pressure for ever more funding to erode its founding ideals of transparency openness and collaboration Many who work or worked for the company insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak or feared retaliation Their accounts suggest that OpenAI for all its noble aspirations is obsessed with maintaining secrecy protecting its image and retaining the loyalty of its employees Since its earliest conception AI as a field has strived to understand human like intelligence and then re create it In Alan Turing the renowned English mathematician and computer scientist began a paper with the now famous provocation \u201cCan machines think \u201d Six years later captivated by the nagging idea a group of scientists gathered at Dartmouth College to formalize the discipline \u201cIt is one of the most fundamental questions of all intellectual history right \u201d says Oren Etzioni the CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence AI2 a Seattle based nonprofit AI research lab \u201cIt\u2019s like do we understand the origin of the universe Do we understand matter \u201d The trouble is AGI has always remained vague No one can really describe what it might look like or the minimum of what it should do It\u2019s not obvious for instance that there is only one kind of general intelligence human intelligence could just be a subset There are also differing opinions about what purpose AGI could serve In the more romanticized view a machine intelligence unhindered by the need for sleep or the inefficiency of human communication could help solve complex challenges like climate change poverty and hunger But the resounding consensus within the field is that such advanced capabilities would take decades even centuries\u2014if indeed it\u2019s possible to develop them at all Many also fear that pursuing this goal overzealously could backfire In the 1970s and again in the late \u201980s and early \u201990s the field overpromised and underdelivered Overnight funding dried up leaving deep scars in an entire generation of researchers \u201cThe field felt like a backwater \u201d says Peter Eckersley until recently director of research at the industry group Partnership on AI of which OpenAI is a member A conference room on the first floor named Infinite Jest Christie Hemm Klok Against this backdrop OpenAI entered the world with a splash on December It wasn\u2019t the first to openly declare it was pursuing AGI DeepMind had done so five years earlier and had been acquired by Google in But OpenAI seemed different For one thing the sticker price was shocking the venture would start with billion from private investors including Musk Altman and PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel The star studded investor list stirred up a media frenzy as did the impressive list of initial employees Greg Brockman who had run technology for the payments company Stripe would be chief technology officer Ilya Sutskever who had studied under AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton would be research director and seven researchers freshly graduated from top universities or plucked from other companies would compose the core technical team Last February Musk announced that he was parting ways with the company over disagreements about its direction A month later Altman stepped down as president of startup accelerator Y Combinator to become OpenAI\u2019s CEO But more than anything OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit status made a statement \u201cIt\u2019ll be important to have a leading research institution which can prioritize a good outcome for all over its own self interest \u201d the announcement said \u201cResearchers will be strongly encouraged to publish their work whether as papers blog posts or code and our patents if any will be shared with the world \u201d Though it never made the criticism explicit the implication was clear other labs like DeepMind could not serve humanity because they were constrained by commercial interests While they were closed OpenAI would be open In a research landscape that had become increasingly privatized and focused on short term financial gains OpenAI was offering a new way to fund progress on the biggest problems \u201cIt was a beacon of hope \u201d says Chip Huyen a machine learning expert who has closely followed the lab\u2019s journey At the intersection of 18th and Folsom Streets in San Francisco OpenAI\u2019s office looks like a mysterious warehouse The historic building has drab gray paneling and tinted windows with most of the shades pulled down The letters \u201cPIONEER BUILDING\u201d\u2014the remnants of its bygone owner the Pioneer Truck Factory\u2014wrap around the corner in faded red paint Inside the space is light and airy The first floor has a few common spaces and two conference rooms One a healthy size for larger meetings is called A Space Odyssey the other more of a glorified phone booth is called Infinite Jest This is the space I\u2019m restricted to during my visit I\u2019m forbidden to visit the second and third floors which house everyone\u2019s desks several robots and pretty much everything interesting When it\u2019s time for their interviews people come down to me An employee trains a watchful eye on me in between meetings The Pioneer Building wikimedia commons tfinc On the beautiful blue sky day that I arrive to meet Brockman he looks nervous and guarded \u201cWe\u2019ve never given someone so much access before \u201d he says with a tentative smile He wears casual clothes and like many at OpenAI sports a shapeless haircut that seems to reflect an efficient no frills mentality Brockman grew up on a hobby farm in North Dakota and had what he describes as a \u201cfocused quiet childhood \u201d He milked cows gathered eggs and fell in love with math while studying on his own In he entered Harvard intending to double major in math and computer science but he quickly grew restless to enter the real world He dropped out a year later entered MIT instead and then dropped out again within a matter of months The second time his decision was final Once he moved to San Francisco he never looked back Brockman takes me to lunch to remove me from the office during an all company meeting In the caf\u00e9 across the street he speaks about OpenAI with intensity sincerity and wonder often drawing parallels between its mission and landmark achievements of science history It\u2019s easy to appreciate his charisma as a leader Recounting memorable passages from the books he\u2019s read he zeroes in on the Valley\u2019s favorite narrative America\u2019s race to the moon \u201cOne story I really love is the story of the janitor \u201d he says referencing a famous yet probably apocryphal tale \u201cKennedy goes up to him and asks him \u2018What are you doing \u2019 and he says \u2018Oh I\u2019m helping put a man on the moon \u2019\u201d There\u2019s also the transcontinental railroad \u201cIt was actually the last megaproject done entirely by hand \u2026 a project of immense scale that was totally risky\u201d and Thomas Edison\u2019s incandescent lightbulb \u201cA committee of distinguished experts said \u2018It\u2019s never gonna work \u2019 and one year later he shipped\u201d Greg Brockman co founder and CTO Christie Hemm Klok Brockman is aware of the gamble OpenAI has taken on\u2014and aware that it evokes cynicism and scrutiny But with each reference his message is clear People can be skeptical all they want It\u2019s the price of daring greatly Those who joined OpenAI in the early days remember the energy excitement and sense of purpose The team was small\u2014formed through a tight web of connections\u2014and management stayed loose and informal Everyone believed in a flat structure where ideas and debate would be welcome from anyone Musk played no small part in building a collective mythology \u201cThe way he presented it to me was \u2018Look I get it AGI might be far away but what if it\u2019s not \u2019\u201d recalls Pieter Abbeel a professor at UC Berkeley who worked there along with several of his students in the first two years \u201c\u2018What if it\u2019s even just a or chance that it\u2019s happening in the next five to years Shouldn\u2019t we think about it very carefully \u2019 That resonated with me \u201d he says But the informality also led to some vagueness of direction In May Altman and Brockman received a visit from Dario Amodei then a Google researcher who told them no one understood what they were doing In an account published in the New Yorker it wasn\u2019t clear the team itself knew either \u201cOur goal right now \u2026 is to do the best thing there is to do \u201d Brockman said \u201cIt\u2019s a little vague \u201d Nonetheless Amodei joined the team a few months later His sister Daniela Amodei had previously worked with Brockman and he already knew many of OpenAI\u2019s members After two years at Brockman\u2019s request Daniela joined too \u201cImagine\u2014we started with nothing \u201d Brockman says \u201cWe just had this ideal that we wanted AGI to go well \u201d Throughout our lunch Brockman recites the charter like scripture an explanation for every aspect of the company\u2019s existence By March of months in the leadership realized it was time for more focus So Brockman and a few other core members began drafting an internal document to lay out a path to AGI But the process quickly revealed a fatal flaw As the team studied trends within the field they realized staying a nonprofit was financially untenable The computational resources that others in the field were using to achieve breakthrough results were doubling every months It became clear that \u201cin order to stay relevant \u201d Brockman says they would need enough capital to match or exceed this exponential ramp up That required a new organizational model that could rapidly amass money\u2014while somehow also staying true to the mission Unbeknownst to the public\u2014and most employees\u2014it was with this in mind that OpenAI released its charter in April of The document re articulated the lab\u2019s core values but subtly shifted the language to reflect the new reality Alongside its commitment to \u201cavoid enabling uses of AI or AGI that harm humanity or unduly concentrate power \u201d it also stressed the need for resources \u201cWe anticipate needing to marshal substantial resources to fulfill our mission \u201d it said \u201cbut will always diligently act to minimize conflicts of interest among our employees and stakeholders that could compromise broad benefit \u201d \u201cWe spent a long time internally iterating with employees to get the whole company bought into a set of principles \u201d Brockman says \u201cThings that had to stay invariant even if we changed our structure \u201d From left to right Daniela Amodei Jack Clark Dario Amodei Jeff Wu technical staff member Greg Brockman Alec Radford technical language team lead Christine Payne technical staff member Ilya Sutskever and Chris Berner head of infrastructure Christie Hemm Klok That structure change happened in March OpenAI shed its purely nonprofit status by setting up a \u201ccapped profit\u201d arm\u2014a for profit with a fold limit on investors\u2019 returns albeit overseen by a board that s part of a nonprofit entity Shortly after it announced Microsoft\u2019s billion dollar investment though it didn\u2019t reveal that this was split between cash and credits to Azure Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing platform Predictably the move set off a wave of accusations that OpenAI was going back on its mission In a post on Hacker News soon after the announcement a user asked how a fold limit would be limiting at all \u201cEarly investors in Google have received a roughly 20x return on their capital \u201d they wrote \u201cYour bet is that you\u2019ll have a corporate structure which returns orders of magnitude more than Google but you don\u2019t want to \u2018unduly concentrate power\u2019 How will this work What exactly is power if not the concentration of resources \u201d The move also rattled many employees who voiced similar concerns To assuage internal unrest the leadership wrote up an FAQ as part of a series of highly protected transition docs \u201cCan I trust OpenAI \u201d one question asked \u201cYes \u201d began the answer followed by a paragraph of explanation The charter is the backbone of OpenAI It serves as the springboard for all the lab\u2019s strategies and actions Throughout our lunch Brockman recites it like scripture an explanation for every aspect of the company\u2019s existence \u201cBy the way \u201d he clarifies halfway through one recitation \u201cI guess I know all these lines because I spent a lot of time really poring over them to get them exactly right It\u2019s not like I was reading this before the meeting \u201d How will you ensure that humans continue to live meaningful lives as you develop more advanced capabilities \u201cAs we wrote we think its impact should be to give everyone economic freedom to let them find new opportunities that aren\u2019t imaginable today \u201d How will you structure yourself to evenly distribute AGI \u201cI think a utility is the best analogy for the vision that we have But again it\u2019s all subject to the charter \u201d How do you compete to reach AGI first without compromising safety \u201cI think there is absolutely this important balancing act and our best shot at that is what\u2019s in the charter \u201d APRIL MINUTE READ OpenAI For Brockman rigid adherence to the document is what makes OpenAI\u2019s structure work Internal alignment is treated as paramount all full time employees are required to work out of the same office with few exceptions For the policy team especially Jack Clark the director this means a life divided between San Francisco and Washington DC Clark doesn\u2019t mind\u2014in fact he agrees with the mentality It\u2019s the in between moments like lunchtime with colleagues he says that help keep everyone on the same page In many ways this approach is clearly working the company has an impressively uniform culture The employees work long hours and talk incessantly about their jobs through meals and social hours many go to the same parties and subscribe to the rational philosophy of \u201c effective altruism \u201d They crack jokes using machine learning terminology to describe their lives \u201cWhat is your life a function of \u201d \u201cWhat are you optimizing for \u201d \u201cEverything is basically a minmax function \u201d To be fair other AI researchers also love doing this but people familiar with OpenAI agree more than others in the field its employees treat AI research not as a job but as an identity In November Brockman married his girlfriend of one year Anna in the office against a backdrop of flowers arranged in an OpenAI logo Sutskever acted as the officiant a robot hand was the ring bearer But at some point in the middle of last year the charter became more than just lunchtime conversation fodder Soon after switching to a capped profit the leadership instituted a new pay structure based in part on each employee\u2019s absorption of the mission Alongside columns like \u201cengineering expertise\u201d and \u201cresearch direction\u201d in a spreadsheet tab titled \u201cUnified Technical Ladder \u201d the last column outlines the culture related expectations for every level Level \u201cYou understand and internalize the OpenAI charter \u201d Level \u201cYou ensure all projects you and your team mates work on are consistent with the charter \u201d Level \u201cYou are responsible for upholding and improving the charter and holding others in the organization accountable for doing the same \u201d The first time most people ever heard of OpenAI was on February That day the lab announced impressive new research a model that could generate convincing essays and articles at the push of a button Feed it a sentence from The Lord of the Rings or the start of a fake news story about Miley Cyrus shoplifting and it would spit out paragraph after paragraph of text in the same vein But there was also a catch the model called GPT was too dangerous to release the researchers said If such powerful technology fell into the wrong hands it could easily be weaponized to produce disinformation at immense scale The backlash among scientists was immediate OpenAI was pulling a publicity stunt some said GPT was not nearly advanced enough to be a threat And if it was why announce its existence and then preclude public scrutiny \u201cIt seemed like OpenAI was trying to capitalize off of panic around AI \u201d says Britt Paris an assistant professor at Rutgers University who studies AI generated disinformation Jack Clark policy director Christie Hemm Klok By May OpenAI had revised its stance and announced plans for a \u201c staged release \u201d Over the following months it successively dribbled out more and more powerful versions of GPT In the interim it also engaged with several research organizations to scrutinize the algorithm\u2019s potential for abuse and develop countermeasures Finally it released the full code in November having found it said \u201cno strong evidence of misuse so far \u201d Amid continued accusations of publicity seeking OpenAI insisted that GPT hadn\u2019t been a stunt It was rather a carefully thought out experiment agreed on after a series of internal discussions and debates The consensus was that even if it had been slight overkill this time the action would set a precedent for handling more dangerous research Besides the charter had predicted that \u201csafety and security concerns\u201d would gradually oblige the lab to \u201creduce our traditional publishing in the future \u201d This was also the argument that the policy team carefully laid out in its six month follow up blog post which they discussed as I sat in on a meeting \u201cI think that is definitely part of the success story framing \u201d said Miles Brundage a policy research scientist highlighting something in a Google doc \u201cThe lead of this section should be We did an ambitious thing now some people are replicating it and here are some reasons why it was beneficial \u201d But OpenAI\u2019s media campaign with GPT also followed a well established pattern that has made the broader AI community leery Over the years the lab\u2019s big splashy research announcements have been repeatedly accused of fueling the AI hype cycle More than once critics have also accused the lab of talking up its results to the point of mischaracterization For these reasons many in the field have tended to keep OpenAI at arm\u2019s length Cover images of OpenAI s research releases hang on its office wall Christie Hemm Klok This hasn\u2019t stopped the lab from continuing to pour resources into its public image As well as research papers it publishes its results in highly produced company blog posts for which it does everything in house from writing to multimedia production to design of the cover images for each release At one point it also began developing a documentary on one of its projects to rival a minute movie about DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo It eventually spun the effort out into an independent production which Brockman and his wife Anna are now partially financing I also agreed to appear in the documentary to provide technical explanation and context to OpenAI\u2019s achievement I was not compensated for this And as the blowback has increased so have internal discussions to address it Employees have grown frustrated at the constant outside criticism and the leadership worries it will undermine the lab\u2019s influence and ability to hire the best talent An internal document highlights this problem and an outreach strategy for tackling it \u201cIn order to have government level policy influence we need to be viewed as the most trusted source on ML machine learning research and AGI \u201d says a line under the \u201cPolicy\u201d section \u201cWidespread support and backing from the research community is not only necessary to gain such a reputation but will amplify our message \u201d Another under \u201cStrategy \u201d reads Explicitly treat the ML community as a comms stakeholder Change our tone and external messaging such that we only antagonize them when we intentionally choose to There was another reason GPT had triggered such an acute backlash People felt that OpenAI was once again walking back its earlier promises of openness and transparency With news of the for profit transition a month later the withheld research made people even more suspicious Could it be that the technology had been kept under wraps in preparation for licensing it in the future Ilya Sutskever co founder and chief scientist Christie Hemm Klok But little did people know this wasn\u2019t the only time OpenAI had chosen to hide its research In fact it had kept another effort entirely secret There are two prevailing technical theories about what it will take to reach AGI In one all the necessary techniques already exist it\u2019s just a matter of figuring out how to scale and assemble them In the other there needs to be an entirely new paradigm deep learning the current dominant technique in AI won\u2019t be enough Most researchers fall somewhere between these extremes but OpenAI has consistently sat almost exclusively on the scale and assemble end of the spectrum Most of its breakthroughs have been the product of sinking dramatically greater computational resources into technical innovations developed in other labs Brockman and Sutskever deny that this is their sole strategy but the lab\u2019s tightly guarded research suggests otherwise A team called \u201cForesight\u201d runs experiments to test how far they can push AI capabilities forward by training existing algorithms with increasingly large amounts of data and computing power For the leadership the results of these experiments have confirmed its instincts that the lab\u2019s all in compute driven strategy is the best approach For roughly six months these results were hidden from the public because OpenAI sees this knowledge as its primary competitive advantage Employees and interns were explicitly instructed not to reveal them and those who left signed nondisclosure agreements It was only in January that the team without the usual fanfare quietly posted a paper on one of the primary open source databases for AI research People who experienced the intense secrecy around the effort didn\u2019t know what to make of this change Notably another paper with similar results from different researchers had been posted a few months earlier Christie Hemm Klok In the beginning this level of secrecy was never the intention but it has since become habitual Over time the leadership has moved away from its original belief that openness is the best way to build beneficial AGI Now the importance of keeping quiet is impressed on those who work with or at the lab This includes never speaking to reporters without the express permission of the communications team After my initial visits to the office as I began contacting different employees I received an email from the head of communications reminding me that all interview requests had to go through her When I declined saying that this would undermine the validity of what people told me she instructed employees to keep her informed of my outreach A Slack message from Clark a former journalist later commended people for keeping a tight lid as a reporter was \u201csniffing around \u201d In a statement responding to this heightened secrecy an OpenAI spokesperson referred back to a section of its charter \u201cWe expect that safety and security concerns will reduce our traditional publishing in the future \u201d the section states \u201cwhile increasing the importance of sharing safety policy and standards research \u201d The spokesperson also added \u201cAdditionally each of our releases is run through an infohazard process to evaluate these trade offs and we want to release our results slowly to understand potential risks and impacts before setting loose in the wild \u201d One of the biggest secrets is the project OpenAI is working on next Sources described it to me as the culmination of its previous four years of research an AI system trained on images text and other data using massive computational resources A small team has been assigned to the initial effort with an expectation that other teams along with their work will eventually fold in On the day it was announced at an all company meeting interns weren\u2019t allowed to attend People familiar with the plan offer an explanation the leadership thinks this is the most promising way to reach AGI The man driving OpenAI\u2019s strategy is Dario Amodei the ex Googler who now serves as research director When I meet him he strikes me as a more anxious version of Brockman He has a similar sincerity and sensitivity but an air of unsettled nervous energy He looks distant when he talks his brows furrowed a hand absentmindedly tugging his curls Amodei divides the lab\u2019s strategy into two parts The first part which dictates how it plans to reach advanced AI capabilities he likens to an investor\u2019s \u201cportfolio of bets \u201d Different teams at OpenAI are playing out different bets The language team for example has its money on a theory postulating that AI can develop a significant understanding of the world through mere language learning The robotics team in contrast is advancing an opposing theory that intelligence requires a physical embodiment to develop As in an investor\u2019s portfolio not every bet has an equal weight But for the purposes of scientific rigor all should be tested before being discarded Amodei points to GPT with its remarkably realistic auto generated texts as an instance of why it\u2019s important to keep an open mind \u201cPure language is a direction that the field and even some of us were somewhat skeptical of \u201d he says \u201cBut now it s like \u2018Wow this is really promising \u2019\u201d Over time as different bets rise above others they will attract more intense efforts Then they will cross pollinate and combine The goal is to have fewer and fewer teams that ultimately collapse into a single technical direction for AGI This is the exact process that OpenAI\u2019s latest top secret project has supposedly already begun Dario Amodei research director Christie Hemm Klok The second part of the strategy Amodei explains focuses on how to make such ever advancing AI systems safe This includes making sure that they reflect human values can explain the logic behind their decisions and can learn without harming people in the process Teams dedicated to each of these safety goals seek to develop methods that can be applied across projects as they mature Techniques developed by the explainability team for example may be used to expose the logic behind GPT \u2019s sentence constructions or a robot\u2019s movements Amodei admits this part of the strategy is somewhat haphazard built less on established theories in the field and more on gut feeling \u201cAt some point we\u2019re going to build AGI and by that time I want to feel good about these systems operating in the world \u201d he says \u201cAnything where I don\u2019t currently feel good I create and recruit a team to focus on that thing \u201d For all the publicity chasing and secrecy Amodei looks sincere when he says this The possibility of failure seems to disturb him \u201cWe\u2019re in the awkward position of we don\u2019t know what AGI looks like \u201d he says \u201cWe don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to happen \u201d Then with careful self awareness he adds \u201cThe mind of any given person is limited The best thing I\u2019ve found is hiring other safety researchers who often have visions which are different than the natural thing I might\u2019ve thought of I want that kind of variation and diversity because that\u2019s the only way that you catch everything \u201d The thing is OpenAI actually has little \u201cvariation and diversity\u201d\u2014a fact hammered home on my third day at the office During the one lunch I was granted to mingle with employees I sat down at the most visibly diverse table by a large margin Less than a minute later I realized that the people eating there were not in fact OpenAI employees Neuralink Musk\u2019s startup working on computer brain interfaces shares the same building and dining room Daniela Amodei head of people operations Christie Hemm Klok According to a lab spokesperson out of the over employees are female or nonbinary There are also two women on the executive team and the leadership team is women she said though she didn\u2019t specify who was counted among these teams All four C suite executives including Brockman and Altman are white men Out of over employees I identified on LinkedIn and other sources the overwhelming number were white or Asian In fairness this lack of diversity is typical in AI Last year a report from the New York\u2013based research institute AI Now found that women accounted for only of authors at leading AI conferences of AI professorships and and of research staff at Facebook and Google respectively \u201cThere is definitely still a lot of work to be done across academia and industry \u201d OpenAI\u2019s spokesperson said \u201cDiversity and inclusion is something we take seriously and are continually working to improve by working with initiatives like WiML Girl Geek and our Scholars program \u201d Indeed OpenAI has tried to broaden its talent pool It began its remote Scholars program for underrepresented minorities in But only two of the first eight scholars became full time employees even though they reported positive experiences The most common reason for declining to stay the requirement to live in San Francisco For Nadja Rhodes a former scholar who is now the lead machine learning engineer at a New York\u2013based company the city just had too little diversity But if diversity is a problem for the AI industry in general it\u2019s something more existential for a company whose mission is to spread the technology evenly to everyone The fact is that it lacks representation from the groups most at risk of being left out Nor is it at all clear just how OpenAI plans to \u201cdistribute the benefits\u201d of AGI to \u201call of humanity \u201d as Brockman frequently says in citing its mission The leadership speaks of this in vague terms and has done little to flesh out the specifics In January the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University released a report in collaboration with the lab proposing to distribute benefits by distributing a percentage of profits But the authors cited \u201csignificant unresolved issues regarding \u2026 the way in which it would be implemented \u201d \u201cThis is my biggest problem with OpenAI \u201d says a former employee who spoke on condition of anonymity Christie Hemm Klok \u201cThey are using sophisticated technical practices to try to answer social problems with AI \u201d echoes Britt Paris of Rutgers \u201cIt seems like they don\u2019t really have the capabilities to actually understand the social They just understand that that\u2019s a sort of a lucrative place to be positioning themselves right now \u201d Brockman agrees that both technical and social expertise will ultimately be necessary for OpenAI to achieve its mission But he disagrees that the social issues need to be solved from the very beginning \u201cHow exactly do you bake ethics in or these other perspectives in And when do you bring them in and how One strategy you could pursue is to from the very beginning try to bake in everything you might possibly need \u201d he says \u201cI don\u2019t think that that strategy is likely to succeed \u201d The first thing to figure out he says is what AGI will even look like Only then will it be time to \u201cmake sure that we are understanding the ramifications \u201d Last summer in the weeks after the switch to a capped profit model and the billion injection from Microsoft the leadership assured employees that these updates wouldn\u2019t functionally change OpenAI\u2019s approach to research Microsoft was well aligned with the lab\u2019s values and any commercialization efforts would be far away the pursuit of fundamental questions would still remain at the core of the work For a while these assurances seemed to hold true and projects continued as they were Many employees didn\u2019t even know what promises if any had been made to Microsoft But in recent months the pressure of commercialization has intensified and the need to produce money making research no longer feels like something in the distant future In sharing his vision for the lab privately with employees Altman\u2019s message is clear OpenAI needs to make money in order to do research\u2014not the other way around This is a hard but necessary trade off the leadership has said\u2014one it had to make for lack of wealthy philanthropic donors By contrast Seattle based AI2 a nonprofit that ambitiously advances fundamental AI research receives its funds from a self sustaining at least for the foreseeable future pool of money left behind by the late Paul Allen a billionaire best known for cofounding Microsoft But the truth is that OpenAI faces this trade off not only because it\u2019s not rich but also because it made the strategic choice to try to reach AGI before anyone else That pressure forces it to make decisions that seem to land farther and farther away from its original intention It leans into hype in its rush to attract funding and talent guards its research in the hopes of keeping the upper hand and chases a computationally heavy strategy\u2014not because it\u2019s seen as the only way to AGI but because it seems like the fastest Yet OpenAI is still a bastion of talent and cutting edge research filled with people who are sincerely striving to work for the benefit of humanity In other words it still has the most important elements and there\u2019s still time for it to change Near the end of my interview with Rhodes the former remote scholar I ask her the one thing about OpenAI that I shouldn\u2019t omit from this profile \u201cI guess in my opinion there\u2019s problems \u201d she begins hesitantly \u201cSome of them come from maybe the environment it faces some of them come from the type of people that it tends to attract and other people that it leaves out \u201d \u201cBut to me it feels like they are doing something a little bit right \u201d she says \u201cI got a sense that the folks there are earnestly trying \u201d Update We made some changes to this story after OpenAI asked us to clarify that when Greg Brockman said he didn\u2019t think it was possible to \u201cbake ethics in\u2026 from the very beginning\u201d when developing AI he intended it to mean that ethical questions couldn\u2019t be solved from the beginning not that they couldn\u2019t be addressed from the beginning Also that after dropping out of Harvard he transferred straight to MIT rather than waiting a year Also that he was raised not \u201con a farm \u201d but on a hobby farm Brockman considers this distinction important In addition we have clarified that while OpenAI did indeed shed its nonprofit status a board that is part of a nonprofit entity still oversees it and that OpenAI publishes its research in the form of company blog posts as well as not in lieu of research papers We\u2019ve also corrected the date of publication of a paper by outside researchers and the affiliation of Peter Eckersley former not current research director of Partnership on AI which he recently left", "page_url":

members for the novel coronavirus beginning with those highest at risk or deemed essential to operations with the goal of testing all service members by summer Air Force Gen John Hyten vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Wednesday that the broader testing policy moves the department from a diagnostic process to a diagnostic screening approach that with public health measures will improve readiness Testing is a powerful tool that when combined with quarantine and other public health measures can improve our overall force availability Hyten said Under the new system tier one service members have top priority including active duty and Reserve personnel treating COVID patients and those working in field hospitals and alternate facilities as well as personnel in critical national security roles such as nuclear forces and special operations counter terrorism units The next group to receive testing will include service members deployed for overseas contingency operations followed by those stationed overseas as well as personnel scheduled to deploy Finally tier four will be all other forces Hyten said Related COVID Outbreak Forces Destroyer Kidd to Return to Port Offload Crew He said testing for the first group is underway as is testing for all new basic trainees and is expected to be completed by the end of the month while tier two and three tests could be complete by early June I think we ll rapidly get into tier two and tier three Hyten said While Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Mark Milley said he would like the U S military to reach a point where it is conducting tests a day Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist said Wednesday that starting with tests a week will meet the services critical needs What we re looking at to cover is the key tiers It s when the submarines set sail it s not just every submarine crew Norquist said The new approach is in addition to the immediate testing of individuals with symptoms and all hospital patients Previous guidance issued by the Pentagon reserved testing for symptomatic patients at high risk for developing a severe case of the disease including those who are older or have an underlying health condition and anyone hospitalized The services also will continue screening for symptoms with questionnaires and temperature checks tracking potential exposure and enforcing day quarantines Hyten said the DoD is working with the White House the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Health and Human Services Department along with the private sector to obtain test kits and analysis equipment As of Friday military personnel have tested positive for COVID and have been hospitalized This includes nearly sailors soldiers airmen Marines and members of the Army and Air Force National Guard many of whom have been called up to assist with COVID response in their states Since the pandemic became more widespread in the United States National Guard members have been activated and more

millionenschweres Paket zur Digitalisierung der Bundeswehr als weitgehend wirkungslos bezeichnet In einem vertraulichen Bericht vom Oktober schreiben die Pr\u00fcfer das Verteidigungsministerium habe seinen Plan zur Anschaffung von Zehntausenden neuen Laptops f\u00fcr rund Millionen Euro weder konzeptionell abgeleitet noch dokumentiert Zudem w\u00fcrden durch interne Fehlplanungen auch nach der Anschaffung der Rechner kaum mehr Soldaten als bisher mobil arbeiten k\u00f6nnen Der seitige Bericht liegt dem SPIEGEL vor Die Kritik des Rechnungshofs bezieht sich auf eine sogenannte Millionen Vorlage des Ministeriums \u00fcber die der Haushaltsausschuss des Bundestags am Mittwoch beraten sollte In dem umfangreichen Paket zur Finanzierung des bundeseigenen IT Dienstleisters BWI findet sich unter anderem der Plan neue Laptops f\u00fcr die Bundeswehr einzukaufen und so die Zahl von mobilen Rechnern auf zu erh\u00f6hen Dies sei zur Realisierung eines sukzessiven \u00dcbergangs zu einer mobilen IT Ausstattung n\u00f6tig bis sollten letztlich alle Soldaten mobil arbeiten k\u00f6nnen Faktisch kann nur ein F\u00fcnftel der Soldaten mobil arbeiten Die Pr\u00fcfer haben sich das Projekt das die fr\u00fchere Verteidigungsministerin Ursula von der Leyen angesto\u00dfen hatte genauer angesehen und erhebliche Fehlplanungen entdeckt So fanden sie heraus dass trotz der Laptop Offensive auch in den kommenden Jahren kaum mehr Soldaten als bisher mobil arbeiten k\u00f6nnen Der Grund sind die limitierten Zug\u00e4nge zum gesicherten Intranet der Bundeswehr \u00fcber das Soldaten beispielsweise Mails abrufen oder Zugang zu eingestuften Planungsunterlagen oder bestimmten Projektgruppen bekommen k\u00f6nnen Die von den Pr\u00fcfern recherchierten Zahlen sind eindeutig So will die Bundeswehr zwar die Zahl an mobilen Endger\u00e4ten die sich \u00fcber einen Remote Access Service ins gesch\u00fctzte Intranet einloggen k\u00f6nnen in den n\u00e4chsten Jahren auf insgesamt erh\u00f6hen Trotzdem so der Rechnungshof k\u00f6nnten von den dann mobilen Rechnern nur maximal Rechner gleichzeitig auf das Intranet zugreifen Dass faktisch nur ein F\u00fcnftel der Soldaten mobil arbeiten kann so die Pr\u00fcfer habe das Ministerium bei den Cyber Planungen nicht ausreichend ber\u00fccksichtigt Geht es nach den Pr\u00fcfern ist der Erfolg der Kampagne durch die Fehlplanungen akut gef\u00e4hrdet W\u00f6rtlich schreiben die Pr\u00fcfer die Bundeswehr gerate durch die Limitierung beim Zugang zum Intranet in eine Art IT Mangelwirtschaft da man den Intranet Zugang aufwendig koordinieren muss Das Urteil der Experten Auch wenn das Ministerium mit seinem Ansatz eigentlich die Attraktivit\u00e4t des Arbeitgebers Bundeswehr steigern will kann die Mangelwirtschaft das Gegenteil bewirken V\u00f6llig konzeptlos Die Reaktion aus dem Ministerium illustriert indes die antiquierte Sicht des Hauses auf die digitale Welt So rechtfertigte das Ressort seine Pl\u00e4ne mit dem Hinweis die Soldaten k\u00f6nnten ja innerhalb der Kasernen der Bundeswehr fast immer auf das gesch\u00fctzte Intranet der Truppe zugreifen F\u00fcr das mobile Arbeiten zu Hause sei es zudem m\u00f6glich mit zuvor lokal abgespeicherten Daten offline zu arbeiten Der Rechnungshof schreibt dazu n\u00fcchtern dieser Ansatz des Wehrressorts erf\u00fclle nicht den Anspruch an eine moderne und leistungsf\u00e4hige mobile IT Ausstattung Die Kritik an dem Laptop Ankauf ist nicht die einzige R\u00fcge So peilt das Ministerium an die Zahl der mobilen Arbeitspl\u00e4tze bis auf zu erh\u00f6hen Der Rechnungshof merkt dazu an das Ministerium habe nicht dargelegt warum es einen solchen \u00dcbergang zu einer mobilen IT Ausstattung f\u00fcr erforderlich h\u00e4lt und wie es diesen gestalten will Bei den Pl\u00e4nen handele es sich um rein strategische \u00dcberlegungen Laut den Pr\u00fcfern bestehe deswegen das Risiko dass das Ministerium am eigentlichen Bedarf vorbeiplant und unwirtschaftlich beschafft Im Haushaltsausschuss sorgte der vertrauliche Pr\u00fcfbericht bereits f\u00fcr erhebliche Unruhe Auf Dr\u00e4ngen der SPD wurde das Thema nach SPIEGEL Informationen spontan wieder von der Tagesordnung f\u00fcr diese Woche genommen da die Haush\u00e4lter noch erheblichen Kl\u00e4rungsbedarf zu der Vorlage sehen Von den Gr\u00fcnen kam ebenfalls harsche Kritik

launches the Noor satellite to orbit Photograph courtesy of SalamPix ABACAPRESS COM By Sina Azodi The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 IRGC successful launch of the Noor Light satellite into space is a significant moment at a time when many countries including Iran are still grappling with the deadly COVID virus It marks a military advancement an audacious move in the diplomatic poker game with Washington and an effort to restore domestic political legitimacy after a series of blunders The Noor military satellite which used a three stage propellant reached an orbit of kilometers earning a \u201ccode designator\u201d by the North American Aerospace Defense Command NORAD Iranian state media are claiming that this is the first time that Iran has successfully \u201coperationalized\u201d a three stage missile Meanwhile the US Space Command has classified Noor as a CubeSat \u201cresearch\u201d spacecraft While Iran has sought to portray failed past satellite launches as civilian in nature Iranian officials have made it clear that Noor has military purposes The Space Commander of the IRGC Aerospace Force Brigadier General Ali Jafarabadi told Iranian State TV that the primary mission of Noor is \u201creconnaissance \u201d but that its secondary missions include \u201cnavigation and military communications \u201d Jafarabadi also noted that \u201cIn our defense field we should be aware of our situation and our surroundings\u2026the sensors that have been installed on this satellite do the job for us \u201d Another IRGC top commander Ali Hajizadeh whose units accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger aircraft in January\u2014they mistook it for a hostile US missile\u2014 proclaimed that \u201cgaining access to space and using it is not a choice It is an inevitable necessity and we must find our place in space \u201d In the past Iran\u2019s failed satellite launches were conducted by Iran\u2019s Space Agency which was founded to \u201ccoordinate and publicize the nation\u2019s space efforts \u201d Hence this is the first time that the IRGC has launched a military satellite into orbit US defense officials called the launch a \u201c provocation \u201d and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo a staunch critic of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action JCPOA accused Iran of violating UN Security Council Resolution which endorsed the JCPOA Pompeo who reportedly is considering snapping back all UN sanctions on Iran that were lifted by the resolution\u2014even though the US withdrew unilaterally from the JCPOA\u2014 vowed to \u201chold Iran accountable \u201d Brian Hook the State Department\u2019s Special Representative for Iran also asserted that \u201cIran\u2019s space program is clearly a cover for its intercontinental ballistic missile ICBM aspirations \u201d As a Defense Intelligence Agency report notes expertise in Space Launch Vehicles SLVs can be used \u201cas a test bed for developing an ICBM \u201d However Michael Elleman an expert on missiles at the International Institute for Strategic Studies has argued that a satellite launch is not tantamount to an ICBM test because of some technological differences Elleman has further noted that the Qassed Messenger rocket which propelled Noor into orbit could have a range of a little more than km if it was repurposed This is generally consistent with Iranian officials\u2019 previous statements that Iran has voluntarily limited the range of its ballistic missiles to kms Fabian Hinz of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies argues that the Qassed is \u201ctoo limited in performance to serve as an ICBM with any reasonable payload \u201d Meanwhile General Jay Raymond the Chief of Staff of Space Operations downplayed the military significance of Noor by tweeting on April that \u201cIran states it has imaging capabilities\u2014actually it\u2019s a tumbling webcam in space unlikely providing intel \u201d These assessments could further strengthen the idea that the satellite launch carries more political weight than military significance While the deployment of the satellite is a significant technological breakthrough for Iran after several attempts that may have been sabotaged by the US and or Israel the IRGC\u2019s move should be analyzed more in terms of Tehran\u2019s political posturing instead of as a strategic leap toward developing ICBMs Since the Trump administration\u2019s decision to re impose economic sanctions on Iran Tehran has upped the ante by reducing its own compliance under the nuclear deal confiscating oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and in the aftermath of the US assassination of Quds Force leader General Qasem Soleimani has attacked American forces in Iraq using indigenously developed ballistic missiles In essence it seems that Iran feels that it must not show weakness under tremendous pressure It is noteworthy that the virus stricken country is taking advantage of Washington\u2019s own preoccupation with the pandemic to flex its muscles Launching a military satellite into space and using mobile launchers that are harder to detect can send a strong political message to Washington The IRGC\u2019s satellite launch can also be viewed in terms of the Guard\u2019s broader campaign to recapture some domestic legitimacy after a series of devastating political and intelligence blunders which have left an indelible mark on its reputation as a military organization The accidental shooting of the Ukrainian passenger plane in the fog of war of the January crisis and subsequent attempts at a cover up are cases in point IRGC officials have tried to revamp and tie the satellite launch to the potent force of Iranian nationalism calling it a \u201cnational\u201d achievement One should further not discount the fact that creating an advanced \u201cindigenous\u201d technology is quite significant for a developing country such as Iran Hossein Dalirian former director of the IRGC affiliated Tasnim News\u2019 Defense Desk writes that \u201cmany countries do not have such technological capacities and have to beg world powers such as the United States to provide them with communications and even imagery from space which is very expensive \u201d Narges Bajoghli an expert on the IRGC and a professor of Middle East Studies at the Johns Hopkins University\u2018s School of Advanced International Studies has argued that \u201cOver the last decade they IRGC have refocused their media production on depicting how the guards protected Iran from outside aggression moving religious symbols to the background \u201d In the aftermath of the satellite launch an IRGC affiliated outlet published a poster with the caption reading \u201cToday we can monitor the world from space and this means expanding the strategic intelligence of the powerful IRGC defensive force We will not accept any limits in strengthening the country and our nation and will innovate any legitimate tool \u201d To better understand Iran\u2019s move one must keep in mind that for Iranians the line between national security on the one hand and pride and a sense of victimhood on the other is blurry In other words a proud and independent Iran must also be strong Joining the club of \u201cadvanced\u201d countries with the capability to launch satellites\u2014albeit in its early stages\u2014is important for Iranians Thus under economic strangulation by the United States Iran has managed to send a clear message that it will not yield under pressure Sina Azodi Photograph courtesy of the author Sina Azodi is a non resident fellow at the Atlantic Council He is also a foreign policy advisor at Gulf State Analytics and a PhD candidate in

Peter Florence the supremo of this great literary festival asked me some months ago if I might as part of Hay\u2019s celebration of the five hundredth anniversary of Martin Luther\u2019s kickstarting of the reformation suggest a reform of the internet Firstly let me say that despite a lifetime immersing myself in what I consider the provoking beguiling bewitching and often befuddling joy of technological development especially in the realm of information technology networking and shiny digital devices I am no computer scientist coder or programmer Many people some of them no doubt here in this tent now will know much more about the subject I\u2019m going to discourse upon Take this if you take it all as the offering of a curious mind curious in both sense avid for information and just plain odd You will be relieved to know that unlike Martin Luther I do not have a full theses to nail to the door or in Hay\u2019s case to the tent flap It might be worth reminding ourselves perhaps however of the great excitements of the early 16th century I do not think it is a coincidence that Luther grew up as one of the very first generation to have access to printed books much as some of you may have children who were the first to grow up with access to e books to iPads and to the internet Johannes Gutenberg\u2019s great project his Bible bore fruit in \u2013 perhaps or so copies on paper and on vellum calfskin \u2013 but Gutenberg had in fact already given this new art of moveable metal type printing a trial run a proof of concept in the production of hundreds perhaps thousands of Papal indulgences An indulgence was a piece of paper signed and sealed by the Vatican Whoever could afford such a holy ticket could buy it and be \u2026 well indulged They could in effect sin \u2013 up to and including the face value of the indulgence they bore which held good officially for no more than years but indulgences were soon produced with expiry dates of and in a few recorded cases years allowing the lucky purchaser to go straight to paradise without passing purgatory Just as you can buy carbon credit now so you could buy this Vatican vice voucher a sin offset document The Church originally had their monks and clerks write these by hand but then thanks to Gutenberg they had thousands of them printed at a fraction of the cost to raise money for amongst other things the completion of St Peter\u2019s in Rome but also \u2013 as Luther noted \u2013 for the lining of individual pockets and the filling of personal coffers It was this venal and corrupt practice that led Luther to proclaim his theses The technology then had intensified the corruption but it was that same technology that was to spread the word of Luther\u2019s protest and prime the pump of the Protestant reformation This always seems to be the way with technological innovation As much as it is a vector of negative disruption \u2013 corruption indeed \u2013 it is also the vector of progress and improvement In there were no printed books in the world by there were millions Printing itself was and is morally and doctrinally neutral without positive or negative valency per se it could as well be used for the dissemination of official catholic propaganda to use the Vatican\u2019s own word as it could be used for the transmission of what the church would consider subversive or heretical material This held true over the centuries Printing frustrated the church on the one hand \u2013 they had Diderot imprisoned for recruiting scholars and contributors to his great Encyclop\u00e9die a project that attempted to describe the world in enlightenment and scientific terms \u2013 but on the other printing allowed the propagation of printed bibles for missions around all the newly colonised corners of the world spreading the power reach and authority of the Holy See It is worth remembering this point the technology itself is neutral Gutenberg\u2019s printing revolution by way of Das Kapital and Mein Kampf by way of smashed samizdat presses in pre Revolutionary Russia by way of The Origin of Species and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion by way of the rolling offset lithos of Fleet Street Dickens Joyce J K Rowling Mao\u2019s Little Red Book and Hallmark greetings cards brought us to the world into which all of us were born it brought us amongst other things \u2013 quite literally \u2013 here to Hay on Wye I started coming to this great festival before the word Kindle had a technological meaning when an \u201ce book\u201d might be a survey of 90s Rave drug Culture or possibly an Ian McMillan glossary of Yorkshire Dialect Printed books haven\u2019t gone away indeed we are most of us I suspect pleased to learn how much they have come roaring back in parallel with vinyl records and other instances of analogue refusal to die But the difference between an ebook and a printed book is as nothing when set beside the influence of digital technology as a whole on the public weal international polity and the destiny of our species It has embedded itself in our lives with enormous speed If you are not at the very least anxious about that then perhaps you have not quite understood how dependent we are in every aspect of our lives \u2013 personal professional health wealth transport nutrition prosperity mind body and spirit The great Canadian Marshall McLuhan \u2013\u2013 philosopher should one call him \u2013 whose prophetic soul seems more and more amazing with each passing year gave us the phrase the \u2018Global Village\u2019 to describe the post printing age that he already saw coming back in the 1950s Where the Printing Age had \u2018fragmented the psyche\u2019 as he put it the Global Village \u2013 whose internal tensions exist in the paradoxical nature of the phrase itself both Global and a village \u2013 this would tribalise us he thought and actually regress us to a second oral age Writing in before even ARPANET the ancestor of the internet existed this is how he forecasts the electronic age which he thinks will change human cognition and behaviour \u201cInstead of tending towards a vast Alexandrian library the world will become a computer an electronic brain exactly as in an infantile piece of science fiction And as our senses go outside us Big Brother goes inside So unless aware of this dynamic we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums total interdependence and superimposed co existence \u2026 Terror is the normal state of any oral society for in it everything affects everything all the time \u2026 In our long striving to recover for the Western world a unity of sensibility and of thought and feeling we have no more been prepared to accept the tribal consequences of such unity than we were ready for the fragmentation of the human psyche by print culture\u201d Like much of McLuhan\u2019s writing densely packed with complex ideas as they are this repays far more study and unpicking than would be appropriate here but I think we might all agree that we have arrived at that \u201cphase of panic terrors\u201d he foresaw Let me suggest a few of the anxieties we feel about the digital world today Aside from the ugliness and ferocity of trolling on social media we fret over the so called post truth age with its arguments over what is \u2018fake news\u2019 and what are \u2018alternative facts\u2019 and the concomitant diminution of trust in any authoritative source of information or consensus as to the validity and credibility of news and current events at all The refusal of social media platforms to take responsibility for those dangerous fake defamatory inflammatory and fake items whose effects would have legal consequences for traditional printed or broadcast media but which they can escape The rise of big data and one\u2019s personal footprint of analytics spending and preferences becoming willy nilly corporate property The ever present threat to our privacy that this involves concerns us Everyone we know everything we read watch listen to eat everything we desire and perhaps every electronic message we send \u2013 all readable by a corporation or a government The unfair non contractual working practices afoot in the so called Gig Economy \u2013 Uber Drivers delivery couriers and so on Not to mention the effect of those services on the pre existing workforce of cab drivers and others whose hard won qualifications might be set at nought The ghettoisation of opinion and identity known as the filter bubble apportioning us narrow sources of information that accord with our pre existing views giving a whole new power to cognitive bias entrenching us in our political and social beliefs ever widening the canyon between us and those who disagree with us And the more the canyon widens the farther away the other side and the less likely we are to hear or see what goes on there intensifying the problem and always at the super new speeds this digital new world confers The threats to personal national and transnational security \u2013 threats emanating from \u2018bad actors\u2019 that might be cyber extortionists unscrupulous corporations unfriendly foreign powers intrusive domestic governments and their agencies The threat to the young of grooming that leads to abuse or of recruitment that leads to extremist and violent ideologies and actions Algorithms continue every microsecond to harvest data of my movements by GPS for example analyse my actions read my gmail build up information on my mood sexuality political religious and cultural affiliations habits and propensities \u2013 such data is for sale \u2026 Bullying \u2013 especially of the young Body shaming Blackmail Extortion Revenge porn On air suicides encouragements to self harm and live streamed violence The corporate assault on net neutrality The fragile security of our entire digital world and the ever present looming possibility of a Big One that cataclysm brought about either by malice act of war systemic technical failure or some other unforeseen cause an extinction level event which will obliterate our title deeds eliminate our personal records annul our bank accounts and life savings delete all the archives and accumulated data of our existences and create a kind of digital winter for humankind These are some of the things that rightly worry us An example of every one of them can be found almost daily in a story on line or in the mainstream so called dead tree media All of them individually or in a potential catastrophic avalanche threaten to engulf us One thesis I could immediately nail up to the tent flap is to join in the call for aggregating news entities like Facebook to be legally classified as publishers At the moment they are evading responsibility for their content because they can claim to be \u2018platforms\u2019 rather than publishers Given that they are the main source of news for over of the population that is clearly an absurd anomaly If they and Twitter and like platforms recognise their responsibility as publishers it will certainly help them better police their content for unacceptable libels defamations threats and other horrors that a free but legally bound press would as a matter of course be expected to control But that correction of the legal standing and responsibility of social media platforms is almost certainly going to happen and soon and is frankly small potatoes \u2013 as to some extent are the other anxieties I\u2019ve outlined For there is so more so much more coming \u2013 as they say in America \u2013 down the pike Some huge potatoes are looming on the horizon First let\u2019s just take time to remember how it all came about I bought my first computer in We early adopters were like pioneer motorists in the first age of the internal combustion engine You couldn\u2019t feasibly drive a car without knowing how the engine worked Every mile or so you had to in the words of a popular song of the time get out and get under your automobile you had to tweak the magneto and adjust the carburettor and so on And now Now you never have to look at the engine from one year to another All you have to know is how to negotiate the traffic Just like computers and networking No need now to know how to program how to write an Interslip modem script or tweak your subnet mask All you have to know is how to drive the thing such that you can get where you want to get safely and reliably Now of course with both cars and computer networking the highways are clogged one way systems everywhere streets are blocked advertising hoardings deface the roadside toll roads are in operation car thieves patrol your area speed traps parking fees and towing away blights your life and traffic is a nightmare Back then ah the joys of the open road you may have looked silly in your goggles and acoustic couplers but what bliss it was in that dawn to be alive and to be young was very heaven Just as when cars were slow so when modems were slow traffic was light and the illusion was of speed In the 1980s I joined Prestel and CIX text based bulletin boards and information exchanges then CompuServe an online service that allowed GIF in the 80s then finally Demon Internet allowing me to be a cybernaut I literally did not know a single other human being who was on the net I felt like the only person in Britain with a tennis racket Not much chance of a game But I got to know people from other countries as we swapped emails and techniques for getting in and out of university servers There was no world wide web at this point There were search engines like Veronica JANET WAIS the Gopher project telnet irc ftp etc etc A world as ever of initials and acronyms Commercial online services like CompuServe and AOL began to grow and offer their paid customers \u2018ramps\u2019 onto the true wild west of the internet Then came Tim Berners Lee\u2019s invention the worldwide web and the arrival of the first browsers Mosaic and then Netscape It was the early days of portals reliable feature rich for their time home page gateways Excite Lycos Prodigy Alta Vista Earthlink Yahoo Ask Jeeves were the big portal and search engine names The rise of AOL seemed permanent and unstoppable Every shop counter had piles of their introductory CDs every glossy magazine had them taped to their cover They were so big they became the lead name in the giant media corporation they created AOL Time Warner which now embarrassedly hides the name AOL and pretends they don\u2019t exist from hot hot hot to icy cold in less than a decade To have an AOL or hotmail email address is now so uncool it\u2019s probably retro cool again In the mid 90s I did a film Wilde first movie to end credits with a URL \u2013 if you watch the last screen says www oscarwilde com since expired That year an outfit called Google arrived with a fancy new set of search algorithms Steve Jobs rejoined the company he had founded but from which he had been fired The iMac arrived Then came the new millennium and the fear of the year \u2019s millennium bug Things hotted up The iPod \u2018disrupted\u2019 to use that annoying word the whole music industry In Facebook opened up to the world Ten years ago almost to the week the iPhone arrived Twitter landed and various other social media services followed Quora for grownups Snapchat for children Instagram for the tragic and so on And here we are I\u2019m sure you all remember the myth of Pandora\u2019s Box Which was really Pandora\u2019s Jar We call it Pandora\u2019s Box because no less a figure than one of the heroes of early humanism Erasmus mistranslated it The myth was told in Hesiod\u2019s Works and Days which described a pithos or jar It seems Erasmus when he translated it from the original Greek into Latin mistook the word for pyxis meaning box like the pyx in which priests to this day keep the communion host So the jar became a box showing that fake news could spread and replace the truth even before the days of printing Pandora and her jar were all part of Zeus\u2019s revenge on Prometheus and us He had not forgiven him for stealing fire from heaven and giving it to mankind The gods had looked down and seen fires breaking out everywhere industry ceramics cooking foundries for art and war \u2013 but they saw the divine spark too the creative fire that raised us to divine levels Zeus was to punish Prometheus by chaining him to the Caucuses and sending eagles or perhaps vultures to peck out the immortal Titan\u2019s liver every day But mankind he punished in a more subtle way and for once I use the word mankind without fear of being tutted There were no women at this point The god Hephaestus Vulcan to the Romans was commanded by Zeus to create the first human female from clay moistened by his spittle Hephaestus took his wife Aphrodite his mother Hera his aunt Demeter and his sister Athena as models and lovingly sculpted a girl of quite marvellous beauty into whom Aphrodite goddess of love and beauty then breathed life The other gods joined together to equip her uniquely for the world Athena trained her in household crafts embroidery and weaving and dressed her in a glorious silver robe The Charites or Graces were put in charge of accessorising this with necklaces broaches and bracelets of the finest pearl agate jasper and chalcedony The Horai the Hours plaited flowers around her hair until she was so beautiful that all who saw her caught their breath Hera endowed her with authority poise and self possession Apollo taught her skill in music learning archery rhetoric and reason Hermes schooled her in the arts of deception curiosity and cunning And he gave her a name Since each of the gods had conferred upon her a notable talent or accomplishment she was to be called All Gifted which in Greek is Pandora Hephaestus bestowed one more gift upon this paragon which Zeus presented to her himself It was a jar box filled with \u2026 he did not tell her Well you know what happened after weeks of aching curiosity Pandora waited until she was alone in the house and \u2013 she couldn\u2019t help herself which of us could She pulled the jar from its hiding place and twisted the lid Its waxen seal gave way and she pulled it free There was a fast fluttering a furious flapping of wings and a wild wheeling and whirling in her ears She cried out in pain and fright and jumped back as she felt something leathery scaly and bony brush her neck followed by a sharp and terrible prick of pain as some sting or bite pierced her skin More and more flying forms buzzed from the mouth of the jar \u2013 a great cloud of them chattering screaming and howling in her ears With a cry Pandora summoned up the courage and strength to close the lid and seal the jar Like a cloud of locusts the shrieking wailing creatures flew away over the town over the countryside and around the world settling like a pestilence wherever humankind had habitation The names of the creatures were Ponos Hardship Limos Starvation Algos Pain Dysnomia Anarchy Pseudea Lies Neikea Quarrels Amphilogiai Disputes Makhai Wars Hysminai Battles Androktasiai and Phonoi Manslaughters and Murders Illness violence deceit misery cruelty lies and anarchy had arrived They would never leave the earth What Pandora did not know was that when she shut the lid of the jar so hastily she forever imprisoned inside one last little creature which was left behind to beat its wings hopelessly in the box for ever Its name was Elpis Hope The comparison seems rather good don\u2019t you think If Gutenberg\u2019s revolution was Pandora and the Industrial Revolution then the information age is Pandora When I first found out about and joined the internet and watched it grow with the arrival of the www I described it to friends whom I was anxious to convert and get themselves email addresses as the greatest gathering of human beings in the history of the planet As new services came on line and web blossomed into the social media services we now know and perhaps rely on I believed I really believed that humankind might well be saved by the all gifted net It would spread art literature music culture philosophy enlightenment and knowledge In its train would come new freedoms a new understanding between the peoples of the world a new contract This was to be our millennium\u2019s Pandora an all gifted organism that would bring nothing but learning understanding amity comity and friendship I looked at budding projects like Wikipedia and I saw Diderot\u2019s enlightenment dream becoming a reality I saw art galleries and archives becoming freely available to all I saw special interest groups able to exchange information and ideas with their fellows across the globe whether it was coin collecting a love of a particular style of music a shared pleasure in gaming hiking or cosplay a rare physical or mental disorder in common \u2013 suddenly people could contact each other across the world Free translations free lectures tours user generated advice on travel hunting for the best deals and bargains sharing experience in all fields of human endeavour Borders barriers frontiers and boundaries would melt and dissolve An end to tribalism racism ignorance and fear A new dawn for mankind It was all good You are allowed to laugh at my naivety I do myself And when Twitter which I had joined early on thinking it a fun trivial little nonsense that might be worth pursuing when it showed how people could connect in real time as they massed in the squares of Tunisia and Egypt ushering in the Arab Spring my joy was complete What tyrant could endure in this new world How could censorship and propaganda survive when the wisdom and knowledge of crowds was there to shine the light of truth in all the world\u2019s darkest places This was paradise come to earth Utopia made real What could possibly go wrong When did I become aware when did we start to notice that perhaps it wasn\u2019t quite so perfect after all Well the odd caterpillar in the salad or fly in the ointment shouldn\u2019t put us off But the beating of the leathery scaly wings of something worse fluttering from the jar couldn\u2019t be ignored even by so perfectly gullible and optimistic a fool as me The lid had been lifted and trolls were flying out bullies monstrously cruel and malicious thieves extortionists brigands pirates liars con artists predators and monsters Hope was nowhere to be seen So have I gone from dewy eyed dopy and idiotic optimist to dead eyed despondent and despairing pessimist Or perhaps I am doing no more than responding to a few political developments of late that I don\u2019t like and which seem to have been powered by social media If the Brexit vote and the American general election had gone the other way would I and others of my stamp be wringing our hands at the state of the online world Surely these anxieties are just the moaning of the sneering metropolitan coastal elite who have finally been pushed off their smug self satisfied perches by the voice of the real people We have lost The people have spoken The alt right the Trumpians and the Leave Campaign were just more social network savvy smarter better organised and now you feeble Social Justice Warriors are crying foul on the whole system Well I hope I can convince you it isn\u2019t that at all I am a great believer in the Wheel of Fortune not the prime time American gameshow but the Roman rota fortunae It never stops turning Most of us in the this room can remember when Clinton and Blair and their centre left Third Way ruled the roost They were at the very top of the wheel and now they\u2019re at the bottom President Trump is now at the top of the wheel which means he and his kind must by definition according to this metaphor at least be on the way down Indeed I think we can perceive that since his surprise ascent to the apex he is already starting to descend We have passed Peak Trump and the rest of his story will dissolve into mere gossip weird news hilarity and eye popping scandal as he cycles down into failed nullity the fate of even the most distinguished politicians Historical mulch on the floor of history So I hope you see that I am not suggesting that the internet and our digital world are in need of repair because this or that political grouping ebbs or flows waxes or wanes The fact is everything I have thus far spoken about is to some extent old news You might remember that when I listed those anxieties we all share at the moment I added that there is more much more \u201ccoming down the pike\u201d So here\u2019s my estimation of what it is that\u2019s coming I\u2019ll frame it with this memory of my friend Douglas Adams now years dead \u2013 if only he were in my place giving this talk how much his insights into technology art and society are needed I remember he recalled a 1930s Wonder Book of Science that he found in his parents\u2019 attic It had come out around the time of the development of domestically available electric motors a technological advance that we don\u2019t think about these days for a very good reason which I\u2019ll come to I\u2019m talking about the development which would allow a motor to turn just as a steam engine did but without the fuel having to be in the house The fuel was in the power station the electricity came into your home and you could simply switch on an your motor The Wonder Book showed what it imagined would be a Future House of the 1950s In the attic they depicted a huge master motor with a great belt attached to a shaft from which ran other belts turning a clothes mangle for drying laundry a washing machine a record player \u2013 all kinds of devices magically imparted with mechanical motion thanks to the electric motor in the attic Of course the book suggested householders of the future would have to be electric motor literate though they didn\u2019t use that exact phrase able to maintain the motor grease the shafts apply belt stick to the canvas of the belts to stop them slipping and so on This book with its cutaway illustrations and belts on shafts slapping and driving throughout the house looks comically absurd to us But the authors were right electric motors would go on to revolutionise our lives what they failed to foresee is that we wouldn\u2019t have to know a single thing about them They would miniaturise and become embedded in our machines self regulating and invisible They\u2019re in our washing machines in our vacuum cleaners in our CD drives smoothie blenders blu rays ovens car windows fridges printers coffee makers a hundred thousand objects we use all the time but never think twice about The electric motor became people literate Fifty years after the wonder book we were all being told that we had to be computer literate but no \u2013 just as with the electric motors miniature computers appeared in our music players our phones ovens cars washing machines alarm clocks phones cameras coffee makers Well you might have heard of IoT the Internet of Things Just as electric motors and computers began to be seamless transparently almost invisibly incorporated into every days objects that already existed and new ones that were developed for our convenience so internet connection is being baked not only into todays electrical devices and appliances but into ordinary domestic objects too Things Through radio protocols like wifi Near Field Communication and Bluetooth everything from lightbulbs door locks central heating thermostats shopping lists alarm systems fridges luggage clothes human bodies and bloodstreams that are constantly online remotely available and controllable through web smartphone and computer apps I blush to confess I have \u2013 early adopter idiot that I am \u2013 fallen for most of them we have an internet connected fridge in our Los Angeles home and wherever I am in the world I can see inside it thanks to its three cameras Many of these IoT Internet of Things objects so called smart devices are the classic example of a solution looking for a problem I would include my fridge in that But people in all walks of life are now investing hugely in this future millions of IoT products are sold every month you\u2019re probably becoming more and more aware if you haven\u2019t already made the plunge of Virtual Assistants second generation advances on Alexa Siri Hello Google and the freakishly and inexplicably named Cortana These once installed typically as speaker units in the home in order to work listen to every word spoken within auditory range This makes these and all IoT devices you will have realised quickly a soft ripe low hanging target awaiting any hacker who can if so disposed link co opted devices and use them as slave elements in giant bots malicious automated cyber dragons that combine the processing power of their enslaved devices to wreak enormous damage and stage spectacular data and currency heists Many of us who have shown an interest in the development of computing watched over the years as two other nascent technologies struggled to match the almost supernatural properties of their popular science fiction manifestations Robotics and artificial intelligence The great Marvin Minsky regarded by many as the father of Artificial Intelligence knew that whatever kinds of AI were espoused \u2013 brute force expert systems machine learning heuristics genetic programming neural nets \u2013 the reality the successful system would almost certainly be a mix of all those approaches Above all the success of AI was dependent upon reaping the advantages of the ineluctable Moore\u2019s Law that has seen the year on year exponential increases in speeds and memory capacities necessary for the construction of workable AI Gordon Moore the founder of semiconductor company Intel first proposed some time in the 1960s that processing speed power capacity would double every months What he actually said is that you would be able to place double the amount of transistors in the same square inch of silicon which amounts broadly speaking to increasing power and speed This is the reason everything has sped up so extraordinarily Pong the monochrome tennis game with a slidey up and down bat and a square \u2018ball\u2019 was not a result of inefficient unimaginative ignorant computer programming it was the most you could do with chips as they were the programmers were incredibly gifted and pushed the processor to its limit Today\u2019s 3D augmented and virtual reality graphics are no smarter really they\u2019ve just got a Maclaren to drive not a Model T So it\u2019s not just that computing power increases every eighteen months or so it doubles The speed power and capacity from which it is now doubling boggles the mind and allows a whole new kind of technology to arise or if you want to be Yeatsian and apocalyptic to slouch towards Bethlehem to be born The almost metaphysical question of consciousness feeling and the passing of the famous Turing Test aside Moore\u2019s Law\u2019s delivery to developers of ever doubling processing speeds and capacity was always going to turn science fiction into science fact It was never an \u2018if\u2019 or a \u2018whether\u2019 it was always a \u2018when\u2019 As far as cybernetics and robotics are concerned there are different issues of moveable parts and sensory mechanisms Moravec\u2019s paradox comes in to force here which states that computers are very good at what humans find difficult but very bad at what we find easy For example machines can do lightning fast calculations and feats of memory way beyond human capacity but no machine has been built that can approach the motor and perception ability of a one year old Which when you think about it is just as it should be we want machines to be good at the things we find hard and don\u2019t need them to be good at the things we find easy Nonetheless just as physics tries to unify fields of force so technology unifies its different fields and the point is this the Internet of Things Robotics and Artificial Intelligence are now essentially one and the same thing In America I own a car that is capable of autonomous driving I sit on the freeway pull twice on a stalk on the steering wheel fold my arms and tuck in my feet the car one of Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla models does it all \u2013 it brakes when the car approaches a vehicle up ahead and keeps an optimum distance It speeds up when it can It slows to a halt when it needs to and starts again Thanks to GPS it remembers where speed bumps are and raises the suspension the better to handle them It even opens my garage doors automatically as I approach and closes them when I leave home And this is nothing nothing compared to what is to come The impact on our lives and employment is incalculable just as the effect on the world of Tim Berners Lee\u2019s web protocols and programs http and HTML were incalculable We are talking about nothing less than the mass obsolescence of much of the human workforce Not mass unemployment necessarily but mass redeployment certainly Not just in the sector that Americans call blue collar Assembly lines have been replacing humans with machines for years But white collar college educated workers are now being replaced too Already an insurance company in Japan has installed an AI office system that replaces clerical workers with just one whose role is to maintain the AI system Trucks will be autonomous ie driverless very soon And trains of course Fun strikes ahead in the Southern Rail region All this will happen in no longer than the length of time I\u2019ve been coming here to Hay and have watched mobile phones become smart phones watched AOL rise and fall Money is the great driver of course The moment cars that self drive are shown actuarily to have fewer accidents than human driven cars then insurance premiums will sky rocket for those who choose to drive Share holders will adore as they always have the idea of firing workers and replacing them with non unionised systems that never pull a sickie or blow the whistle on dodgy corporate practices It is worth pointing out that when United Airlines cabin crew seemed to beat up and throw off the plane a doctor and hit the headlines accruing staggering negative publicity the share price barely wobbled When rival American Airlines gave their staff a pay rise something that rarely rippled in the news cycle their price immediately plummeted The markets are a kind of artificial intelligence already one that is not very human friendly algorithmically led towards profit whatever the social cost And clearly worrying about the gig economy and the threat Uber drivers pose is almost comically dumb when Uber drivers themselves will be redundant in the very near future What else Douglas Adams\u2019s babel fish a real time language translation device is not very far off The day will come in our lifetimes when we will not be able to distinguish between pieces of music entirely composed by machine and entirely composed by humans You might be familiar with the University of Oregon experiment in which pianist Winifred Kerner played three pieces one by Bach one by a computer program and one by a professor of music at the university called Dr Steve Larson They thought the Larson piece was by a computer the Bach piece was composed by Larson and that the piece written by the computer was genuine Johann Sebastian Bach That experiment took place twenty years ago It is very likely that your next absolute favourite hummable tune will be artificially written Or poem Or novel If intelligent systems can design systems more intelligent than themselves the exponentially steep rate of improvement will dizzy our minds It\u2019s very important to keep this perhaps obvious point in mind in the field of technology we never arrive at a state of finished satisfaction The way things are now is not how they will be in two years time Heraclitus said you cannot step into the same river twice for fresh water is always flowing past you The technological stream similarly allows for no sense of stasis Technology is not a noun it is a verb \u2013 a process We know that our economics is in flux too predicated and dependent on growth growth growth What we have to accept is that there has been a confluence of that economic imperative for growth Moore\u2019s Law of ever increasing computational power human curiosity and ambition and our very particular kind of consumer addiction and need for the new \u2013 all of which have swollen the river of technological progress into flood Great gifts will come this new phase from Pandora of course they will Let me sketch a few more or less at random and far from complete History teaches that everything I say will be an underestimation So AI robotics and smart devices in the biotech and medical sphere are already coming on line the NHS has a deal with Google\u2019s Deep Mind machine learning AI originally a British company Deep Mind is now the world champion at the game Go which it taught itself this kind of AI in the clinical realm will offer earlier diagnosis the ability to read medical imaging data with much more accuracy and spot incipient signs of disease making radiologists for example redundant in the area of virology and related sciences it can assist with analysis of amino acids protein structures and the creation of serums and treatments hugely accelerating drug development we will see the manufacture of greater and better cybernetic prosthesis bionic eyes ears and limbs more robotic surgery faster and more accurate genetic analysis genotyping and biometric data brain computer interfaces will allow thought and dream reading the operation by thought alone of machinery devices musical instruments paint brushes tools brain machine data input and output will transform a huge number of activities and operations allowing the happy combination harnessing Moravec\u2019s paradox of the best human abilities of motor skills and perception with the best machine abilities of calculation and precision we will see care robots for the elderly cyber Mary Poppins guardians and babysitters for children and the vulnerable The fight for greater longevity will unquestionably rely on AI techniques and usher in the possibility of the conquest of death itself We are doubtless used to hearing that the first human to live to years old is already alive the younger people in this room can certainly expect to break the barrier I have been told by more than one solemn faced scientist that the first person to live to is probably alive and that immortality is technically and feasibly within reach In other arenas not counting the world of work we will see better weather forecasting an amelioration of traffic flow automated shopping and delivery A diminution of human error in multiple areas of exchange and interaction will lead to all kinds of undreamed of benefits The next big step for AI is the inevitable achievement of Artificial General Intelligence or AGI sometimes called \u2018full artificial intelligence\u2019 the point at which machines really do think like humans In hundreds of experts were asked when they thought AGI may arise and the median prediction was they year After that the probability most would say certain is artificial super intelligence and the possibility of reaching what is called the Technological Singularity \u2013 what computer pioneer John van Neumann described as the point \u201c\u2026beyond which humans affairs as we know them could not continue \u201d I don\u2019t think I have to worry about that Plenty of you in this tent have cause to and your children beyond question will certainly know all about it Unless of course the climate causes such havoc that we reach a Meteorological Singularity Or the nuclear codes are penetrated by a self teaching algorithm whose only purpose is to find a way to launch\u2026 It\u2019s clear that while it is hard to calculate the cascade upon cascade of new developments and their positive effects we already know the dire consequences and frightening scenarios that threaten to engulf us We know them because science fiction writers and dystopians in all media have got there before us and laid the nightmare visions out Their imaginations have seen it all coming So whether you believe Ray Bradbury George Orwell Aldous Huxley Isaac Asimov Margaret Atwood Ridley Scott Anthony Burgess H G Wells Stanley Kubrick Kazuo Ishiguro Philip K Dick William Gibson John Wyndham James Cameron the Wachowski\u2019s or the scores and scores of other authors and film makers who have painted scenarios of chaos and doom you can certainly believe that a great transformation of human society is under way greater than Gutenberg\u2019s revolution \u2013 greater I would submit than the Industrial Revolution though clearly dependent on it \u2013 the greatest change to our ways of living since we moved from hunting and gathering to settling down in farms villages and seaports and started to trade and form civilisations Whether it will alter the behaviour cognition and identity of the individual in the same way it is certain to alter the behaviour cognition and identity of the group well that is a hard question to answer But believe me when I say that it is happening To be frank it has happened The unimaginably colossal sums of money that have flowed to the first two generations of Silicon Valley pioneers have filled their coffers their war chests and they are all investing in autonomous cars biotech the IoT robotics Artificial Intelligence and their convergence None more so than the outlier the front runner Mr Elon Musk whose neural link system is well worth your reading about online on the great waitbutwhy com website Its author Tim Urban is a paid consultant of Elon Musk\u2019s so he has the advantage of knowing what he is writing about but the potential disadvantage of being parti pri and lacking in objectivity Elon Musk made enough money from his part in the founding and running of PayPal to fund his manifold exploits The Neuralink project joins his Tesla automobile company and subsidiary battery and solar power businesses his Space X reusable spacecraft group his OpenAI initiative and Hyperloop transport system The 1950s and 60s Space Race was funded by sovereign governments this race is funded by private equity by the original investors in Google Apple Facebook and so on Nation states and their agencies are not major players in this game least of all poor old Britain Even if our politicians were across this issue and they absolutely are not our votes would still be an irrelevance When Steve Jobs was asked the secret of his success he often liked to quote the great Canadian ice hockey legend Wayne Gretzky who was asked why he was so far and away the greatest player of his or perhaps any age Gretzky\u2019s reply was that while other players skated to the puck he skated to where the puck was going to be That what how Jobs saw as the necessary practice of the innovator Business leaders and politicos always say with bland regularity that change brings as many opportunities as it brings challenges The dark side of the rise of the machines the sudden obsolescence of so many careers and jobs the insecurity the potential for crime exploitation extortion repression surveillance and even newer forms of cyberterrorism give us the collywobbles and suggest challenges for sure but we must understand that it is going to happen collywobbles initial resistance or not because the lid is already off the jar so the best we can do is keep it off and let hope fly out I do submit that it is nothing short of scandalous to be in the middle of a general election in on the very brink of this awe inspiring terrifying scarcely credible but unquestionably real and imminent revolution and find that politicians are skating not to where the puck is going to be not even to where the puck is but \u2013 as ever \u2013 to where the puck used to be Westminster\u2019s and the main political parties\u2019 records on this subject are truly abysmal Their ignorance and ostrich like refusal to come to terms with the internet\u2019s direction of travel has always been lax ludicrous and laughable but it is also dangerously irresponsible The state of the broadband infrastructure in rural areas is shambolic and contemptuous As for the moaning about the expense and delays and subsequent abandonment of that aborted all new NHS IT system well those chickens have come home to roost haven\u2019t they The scandal of Britain\u2019s largest entity the NHS using ancient Windows XP and even NT systems in with update and security patch costs not paid for Wow The only manifesto commitment I can see on this subject is an unenforceable and irrelevant one that suggests a new Conservative government is going to attempt to increase its powers of control over Internet Service Providers proposing to force ISPs to dislodge their users\u2019 histories there will no doubt more nagging to open up end to end messaging apps too but it\u2019s all skating to where the puck was But we are no good any of us at dealing with the future politicians perhaps least of all thanks to a short electoral cycle and a race to the simplistic unscientific and ill informed bottom when it comes to the future By way of example from another realm Social Care is a hot button issue this electoral cycle but everyone knew twenty years ago that the demographic inevitability of a population bulge going into retirement and old age having to be funded by a dwindling tax base was coming to pass and that is when plans should have been made not now when it is almost too late and much much more expensive and difficult No one had the guts to say these things out loud at election time years ago Similarly no one is talking now of the threat to employment privacy security and civil liberties of the remorseless unstoppable convergence of the Internet of Things Robotics and Artificial Intelligence or of the golden promise of that revolution No one is suggesting how this will impinge on the education of the young and the re education of the working population The phenomenon of the ever expanding service industries we have relied on for so long is all very well but you can have just so many Starbucks and Gregg\u2019s on any given street and who is to say a robo barista isn\u2019t already being trialled somewhere in Seattle or the Santa Clara valley If you have children you should be encouraging them and their teachers to research into the careers of the future some of which are very exciting Social Robotics will be a big field for example well worth looking that up \u2013 it\u2019s a blend of social anthropology psychology and design Then again your son or daughter could be one of the first lawyers to specialise in Robot Rights perhaps work on establishing charters for the building in of values and ethical systems or maybe they will go the other way and start up Robot Brothels catering to all tastes because if history teaches us anything it\u2019s that the sex industry will be coining it before any minister of state works out what\u2019s going on So one thesis I would have to nail up to the tent is to clamour for government to bring all this deeper into schools and colleges The subject of the next technological wave I mean not pornography and prostitution Get people working at the leading edge of AI and robotics to come into the classrooms But more importantly listen to them \u2013 even if what they say is unpalatable our masters must have the intellectual courage and honesty to say if they don\u2019t understand and ask for repetition and clarification This time in other words we mustn\u2019t let the wave engulf us we must ride its crest It\u2019s not quite too late to re gear governmental and educational planning and thinking You could argue convincingly I think that one of Churchill\u2019s greatest qualities one which helped turn the tide of the Second World War was his openness to science and technological development as shown in the Science Museum exhibition a couple of years ago dedicated to his role in that sphere The development of radar which he supported was of course a vital part of the victory in the skies in Sonar too was of incalculable importance in the Battle of the Atlantic Churchill always listened to his adviser Lord Cherwell whom he called the scientific lobe of his brain he got behind wonderful inventions and developments like the Bouncing Bomb Operation Windows and gyroscopes and of course that famous five word note he sent concerning the money going into the decryption developments in Dollis Hill and Bletchley A Treasury official queried the amounts Churchill visited the Research Station and saw the Colossus vacuum tube computer and its Mark version under construction he listened he absorbed and pondered when he returned to Downing Street he scribbled a message to the Treasury \u201cGive them what they want \u201d he wrote That short note could be regarded as one of the founding documents of digital computing Of course you could justly observe that Hitler exhibited a like belief in science and the power of technology prompting Churchill himself in one of his best known speeches to say \u201c\u2026 if we fail then the whole world including the United States including all that we have known and cared for will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister and perhaps more protracted by the lights of perverted science\u2026\u2019\u201d And perverted or not we all benefited from the inventions and technology that emerged from Germany under Nazi rule from tape recording to rockets I said earlier that printing was capable of being perverted into Mein Kampf or The Protocols of the Elders of Zion into ransomware or fake news that incites murder I can\u2019t emphasise this point enough Technology or science do not in and of themselves have moral valency But at the moment we are blaming the technology rather than our lack of preparedness or understanding which as Marshall McLuhan observed is as witless as \u201c\u2026 cussing a buzz saw for lopping off fingers and complaining \u2018but I never saw that coming\u2019 \u201d The witlessness of our leaders and of ourselves is indeed a problem The real danger surely is not technology but technophobic Canute ism a belief that we can control change or stem the technological tide instead of understanding that we need to learn how to harness it Driving cars is dangerous but we developed driving lesson requirements traffic controls seat belts maintenance protocols proximity sensors emission standards \u2013 all kinds of ways of mitigating the danger so as not to deny ourselves the life changing benefits of motoring We understand why angry Ned Ludd destroyed the weaving machines that were threatening his occupation Luddites were prophetic in their way it was weaving machines that first used the punched cards on which computers relied right up to the 1970s We understand too why French workers took their clogs their sabots as they were called and threw them into the machinery to jam it up giving us the word sabotage But we know that they were in the end if you\u2019ll pardon the phrase pissing into the wind No technology has ever been stopped So what is the thesis I am nailing up Well there is no authority for me to protest to no equivalent of Pope Leo X for it to be delivered to and I am certainly no Martin Luther The only thesis I can think worth nailing up is absurdly simple It is a cry as much from the heart as from the head and it is just one word \u2013 Prepare We have an advantage over our hunter gatherer and farming ancestors for whether it is Winter that is coming or a new Spring is entirely in our hands so long as we prepare I can at least unlike Martin Luther thank you for your indulgence Thank you Stephen Fry BBC Arts

bargeldlos bezahlen noch digitale Gelegenheitsarbeiten annehmen Und wer einen kleinen Laden f\u00fchrt lebt immer in der Angst vor Dieben die es auf das Bargeld abgesehen haben Dieser Beitrag stammt aus Ausgabe der Technology Review Das Heft ist ab im Handel sowie direkt im heise shop erh\u00e4ltlich Highlights aus dem Heft Electroneum will den Geldtransfer daher digital abwickeln mit einer Kryptow\u00e4hrung namens ETN Das berichtet die neue Ausgabe von Technology Review jetzt im Handel Eine App mit Wallet \u2013 einer digitalen Geldb\u00f6rse \u2013 fungiert als Kontoersatz Wenn sowohl K\u00e4ufer als auch Verk\u00e4ufer die App eingerichtet haben l\u00e4sst sich eine Zahlung \u00fcber das Mobiltelefon abwickeln Dazu muss der Kassierer lediglich einen Button zur Zahlungsanfor\u00adderung dr\u00fccken Das generiert einen QR Code den der K\u00e4ufer mit seiner App einscannen kann Die App \u00fcbertr\u00e4gt die Zahlung innerhalb weniger Sekunden dank eines von der Firma selbst entwickelten Systems Die \u00adGeb\u00fchren sind dabei im Gegensatz zu vielen anderen Kryptow\u00e4hrungen sehr gering Coin Einsatz mit Belohnungssystem S\u00fcdafrika war das erste Land in dem die Verbreitung des ETN Coins begann Um die Expansion zu f\u00f6rdern hat sich die Firma ein Belohnungssystem einfallen lassen Es sch\u00fcttet sieben Tage lang geringe Coin Betr\u00e4ge in das pers\u00f6nliche Wallet aus Aktiviert man diesen Coin Fluss nicht erneut versiegt er In S\u00fcdafrika und einigen anderen L\u00e4ndern betr\u00e4gt die Auszahlung bis zu drei US Dollar pro Monat Zudem kostet es die Nutzer derzeit noch kein Geld mit ETN zu bezahlen Electroneum finanziert den Dienst aus dem Gr\u00fcndungskapital will zuk\u00fcnftig jedoch Transfergeb\u00fchren von f\u00fcnf ETN berechnen Viele Prepaid Telefonanbieter akzeptieren mittlerweile ETN Coins als Bezahlung f\u00fcr Mobilfunkguthaben Dazu gibt es einen eigenen Bereich in der App in dem man das Land sowie den Anbieter ausw\u00e4hlen und den gew\u00fcnschten Mobilfunktarif direkt buchen kann Den Anfang machte der s\u00fcdafrikanische Finanzdienstleister The Unlimited indem er seinen Kunden eine kostenlose SIM Karte anbot Inzwischen nehmen etwa L\u00e4nder und eine Vielzahl von Tarifanbietern teil Electroneum hat au\u00dferdem ein g\u00fcnstiges Mobiltelefon im Angebot das speziell auf Entwicklungsl\u00e4nder zugeschnitten ist und bei dem die App vorinstalliert ist Auch Jobvermittlung und E Learning Plattform sind geplant Electroneum beschr\u00e4nkt sich jedoch nicht nur auf den Geldverkehr Da \u00adGelegenheitsarbeit im \u00e4rmeren Teil S\u00fcdafrikas weitverbreitet ist hat es mit AnyTask einen Arbeitsmarkt f\u00fcr digitale Kurzzeitjobs ins Leben gerufen Ein Kunde kann beispielsweise eine digitale Bildbearbeitung f\u00fcr wenige Dollar mit einem Klick buchen Dabei bezahlt der Auftraggeber mit seiner Kreditkarte und der Auftragnehmer erh\u00e4lt den Lohn in ETN Eine E Learning Plattform namens TaskSchool ist ebenfalls in Entwicklung Electroneum versucht seinem sozialen Gedanken auch beim Sch\u00fcrfen der M\u00fcnzen treu zu bleiben und l\u00e4sst dazu keine beliebigen Computerfarmen zu Stattdessen erlaubt ein eigens entwickelter Mining Algorithmus der closed source verbleibt dies nur ausgew\u00e4hlten Hilfsorganisationen wie der s\u00fcdafrikanischen

functioning as small teams so the role of a squad leader is integral to a unit s success In the fight against COVID small team leaders are finding themselves faced with a new mission The soldiers of 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team Greywolf 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood Texas have been building and certifying teams responsible for reacting to a positive test for COVID among their ranks Members of the transportation and clean teams for C Company 3rd Battalion 8th Cavalry Regiment recently conducted a battle drill to certify their teams We need to certify our young leaders on their responsibilities said Army Capt Sean Leary commander of C Company We have assigned responsibility for Team Transport and Team Clean and this is our opportunity to certify those young leaders and their ability to accomplish their task The effort comprises four teams Team Trace is made up leaders within the company and battalion and is responsible for tracing the movements of the infected soldier to identify where hot spot cleaning needs to occur and soldiers and civilians may need to be tested due to contact with that area or particular soldier Team Transport is responsible for transporting a positive test soldier to the isolation barracks if the soldier is in another location such as a barracks room or at the hospital Team Clean is responsible for cleaning every identified hot zone where the infected Soldier had been Team Comply ensures not only that the teams are certified and conducting their tasks to standard but also ensures that the unit is practicing proper preventive measures to protect the force My job s important because I don\u2019t want to get another soldier infected just as I wouldn t want one of my loved ones to get infected said Army Sgt Heidi Kiracofe a squad leader with C Company and team leader for Team Clean If we do our job right the first time the risk to our formation is lower Ultimately whether I know someone or not we all wear the same uniform and protecting my brothers and sisters from this enemy is important The certification begins with the unit being notified that a soldier at the hospital has tested positive for COVID and needs to be transported to the isolation barracks The transportation team receives a briefing from the operations sergeant major who also inspects the team to make sure they are in the proper protective gear which includes outer garments such as wet weather gear gloves eye protection and a mask The transportation team travels to the hospital and through mobile communications instructs the soldier to load into the back of the Humvee being sure to avoid contact with the team During this time the unit is lining up a room for the soldier at the isolation barracks and takes the infected soldier there Meanwhile Team Trace begins to identify everywhere the soldier has recently been cleaning hot spots if necessary In this scenario Team Clean cleans the infected soldier s barracks room Kiracofe said the standard is a minimum contact time of minutes of the proper cleaning solution applied to all areas including those small enough that a child could fit a pinky finger The purpose of this certification and making sure they get it right is to protect our soldiers and protect the force and ensuring they can then become trainers themselves and train other NCOs of soldiers who join the team Leary said We never know who will be impacted Each company in the battalion has two transportation teams with two soldiers per team and two clean teams with soldiers on each team Once certified they are then able to train additional soldiers so that teams can switch out personnel as necessary Army Capt Scott Kuhn is assigned to the 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team 1st Cavalry Division",

cheerily dubbed \u201cToblerone Lines\u201d after the famous Swiss chocolate maker but they have other names too More ominous monikers like \u201cdragon teeth\u201d may better fit their original function to repel invading tanks and other vehicles in wartime These lines represent some of the most visible elements of defensive infrastructure in a nation known for its perpetual neutrality \u2014 a position reinforced by the fact that the country is well prepared for attacks Switzerland\u2019s military trained citizens are armed to the proverbial teeth Many Swiss defensive strategies though are far less visible than spiked ridges and openly carried weapons including infrastructure carefully designed and built to self destruct on demand Burning Bridges Reports in that explosives had finally been removed from a bridge on the Swiss German border came as a surprise to some \u2014 mostly those who hadn\u2019t realized it had been wired to blow in the first place The S\u00e4ckinger Bridge was built over the Rhine in and has long been considered a national monument but that didn\u2019t stop the government from rigging it with TNT during the Cold War Military actions like this were part of a larger Swiss defense strategy which included withdrawing to the mountains and fighting a guerrilla war if invaded The idea was to leave rubble rather than functional infrastructure behind These days the Swiss military won\u2019t comment on whether other infrastructure is still rigged for reasons of military security Either way this bridge set up to be demolished on demand is only one example of a longstanding national approach In the 1980s Pulitzer Prize winning journalist John McPhee wrote a book on the role of the Swiss Army in the country\u2019s cultural and physical landscape He naturally covered the well publicized practice of universal military service requirements In La Place de la Concorde Suisse though he also described in detail how the built and natural environments of this small European nation were carefully and extensively weaponized Bridges were not only designed to be blown up to deter invading forces but were also flanked with hidden artillery to foil enemy repair efforts that might follow demolition Along the Alps the insides of mountains were carved out to create bunkers and supply storage spaces while their exterior slopes were rigged to trigger landslides Railroad and highway tunnels were designed to be destroyed quickly too In short for much of the 20th century Swiss infrastructural engineers were tasked with a dual mandate \u2014 they had to make functional and durable structures but also incorporate methods for rapid demolition into their designs VIDEO McPhee\u2019s experience of the country changed as he learned more and more about this ubiquitous militarization Traveling through picturesque mountainside landscapes he began to notice roads that seemed to dead end into mountainsides realizing these may have led to the entrances of bunker complexes Even a single anomalous stone might be a fake placed to conceal a military installation By the 1990s the Department of Defense was in charge of over defensive structures and objects not including the country\u2019s numerous bunkers One Nation Underground Underground Swiss shelters date back to the late 1800s but more comprehensive efforts to fortify the country with subterranean spaces started in the late 1930s as the threat of international war loomed large Indeed extensive Swiss military preparations coupled with the daunting topography of the Alps presumably deterred Axis invaders threatening the country on all sides during World War II \u2014 would be attackers feared an endless guerrilla war Heading into the Cold War the Swiss continued to expand national defenses including bunkers VIDEO Switzerland would eventually build out enough bunker space to house the country\u2019s entire population with room to spare \u2014 with a buffer of over no other country\u2019s shelter capacity comes close The government\u2019s argument for this was that safety from nuclear attack was every citizen\u2019s right \u201cEvery inhabitant must have a protected place that can be reached quickly from his place of residence \u201d read the Swiss Federal Law on Civil Protection and \u201capartment block owners are required to construct and fit out shelters in all new dwellings \u201d Residents uninterested in building their own shelters were required to pay for spaces in communal shelters Some shelters were simple affairs situated in the basements of churches or hospitals or other community buildings but others were massive and sophisticated like a rail tunnel that could be sealed off at each end and then be used to house people in a crisis situation Vernacular Camouflage Military vernacular documented in Fake Chalets by Christian Schwager While many of these efforts were hidden below the ground or tucked into the structural supports of everyday infrastructure vernacular architecture has also played a prominent role in Swiss defense Across the countryside many structures that look like quaint barns or traditional homes were designed to house everything from bunkers to anti aircraft guns with concealment strategies carefully executed by expert craftspeople \u201cThey went about their job with Swiss precision \u201d explains reporter Anneke Bokern \u201cAlthough the bunkers only had to deceive at a minimum distance of meters \u2026 they painted realistic window shutters created perfect imitations of wood grain and even took the position of the sun into consideration\u201d for adding shadows Media attention and books like Christian Schwager\u2019s Fake Chalets have helped make these buildings more of an open secret in recent years in turn drumming up interest in preserving many of these facilities that no longer serve an official purpose Over the last few decades many military structures above ground and below have been declassified and sold off for reuse as homes data centers even cheese factories Visitors can tour some facilities and sleep in others glimpsing cultural artifacts long hidden below the

Communications and Information NCI Agency has successfully delivered a public cloud based solution to allow NATO and non NATO organisations and vessels to share maritime awareness information on an easily accessible platform following a request from Allied Maritime Command MARCOM \u201cThe project is a perfect example of how the NCI Agency was able to quickly tailor a commercial off the shelf solution towards an operational command such as the Allied Maritime Command and effectively improve our ability to enhance maritime situational awareness overnight \u201d said Christopher Smith a Navy Signals Engineer in MARCOM \u201cAs COVID impacted our way of working towards the end of the project we found this new tool to be even more necessary than previously envisioned \u201d Coming online NATO and non NATO organisations alike can access the platform using any internet connected device and it will be used for the first time in the Mediterranean area with possible users having already been identified \u201cWith this new capability NATO has unlocked the ability to share information easily with non NATO partners at sea Cloud based solutions are the key to building NATO\u2019s future a future that is smarter faster and more collaborative than ever before \u201d said Detlef Janezic Chief Service Engineering and Architecture at the NCI Agency While deployed NATO will sometimes establish contacts with non NATO entities such as nations shipping companies and Non Governmental Organisations NGOs but before this technology was delivered however the command could only do so on an ad hoc basis because there was not a common platform for everyone to share information If in the past NATO executed an operation focused on combating piracy and if an NGO monitoring the situation had discovered that a commercial vessel had been hijacked it could have used such a platform to let NATO know Sending NATO that information quickly may have given the alliance an opportunity to take quick action To make this possible the NCI proposed a cloud based platform to give people the tools they would find in an office on land such as chat email and document collaboration Successful collaboration \u201cThis is a fantastic result and we expect use of the platform to grow over time as new maritime communities are incorporated \u201d said Jose Luis Herrero Pascual Head of Service Engineering at the NCI Agency Security concerns were a big part of the NCI\u2019s rationale for choosing the new industry solution and though NATO has some networks of a low level classification they are not considered suitable for supporting operations so the NCI chose a subscription that would offer the maximum number of security features Herrero Pascual said \u201cThe secret to the success of this project was the participation of all the actors needed from the technical perspective to that of the users \u201d said Lt Cdr Giampietro Lungarella A Navy Signals Cyberspace Requirement and Project Officer for MARCOM \u201cIt\u2019s a good opportunity for our cyber security people to learn about security features in a public cloud environment how to harden the solution \u201d Lungarella added \u201cIt\u2019s a good opportunity for us to learn how the operational requirements could be met by a cloud solution \u201d Issues solved The solution also needed to address a problem common to the maritime environment low bandwidth with the platform the NCI chose people on board a vessel can to continue to work even when the connection doesn\u2019t hit the minimum bandwidth They will be able to continue to work offline and the data will be synchronised when the ship finds a better connection Although this is a commercial off the shelf solution it needed some adjustments to make it fit for NATO use As Project Manager Capt Gary Cataldo in Core Enterprise Services at the Agency coordinated monitored and executed those adjustments \u201cWe are taking this as a blueprint project as a way to show that for a certain number of scenarios we can use public cloud solutions \u201d Capt Cataldo said \u201cThis kind of exchange of information with non military actors can be done through

is an important tool in combating COVID Hyten said but service members will still be required to follow White House guidelines on social distancing and wearing face masks to improve our overall force availability The new approach will also involve screening and quarantining for those about to deploy on assignments where social distancing is difficult to impossible such as ships and submarines said Deputy Secretary David Norquist Those individuals will be screened with questionnaires and thermometers to identify at risk personnel Those deemed to be at risk will then be put in quarantine for to days to identify possible infections he said Prior to leaving quarantine we will conduct a swab test and a temperature check to identify individuals who are infected but still do not show it Norquist said As the unit then moves to its mission we will keep the group together but with limited outside interaction to prevent introduction of infection from outside Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen Mark Milley last week announced an aspirational goal of having the military conduct tests a day by the end of June But Hyten and Norquist said a target of tests per week would likely be achieved by the end of June To get to the entire force the million active duty and the entire National Guard and Reserve is going to take us into the summer but I think we ll get to the deploying redeploying forces the

existing morgues There was no plan for such a crisis so each region is responding according to what facilities and spaces are available In Devon refrigerated lorries have been set up on an empty lot

temporary infrastructure It is an Olympian effort of scaffolding marquees inflatable tents and portable cabins as existing buildings have been repurposed in a matter of days With construction having to begin before plans were finalised in many cases architects engineers and fabricators are responding at a speed that leaves time for no more than basic essentials This is emergency architecture at its most elemental Workers outside a hangar at Birmingham airport which is being converted into a large morgue Photograph Jacob King PA Portakabin the York based firm that has been synonymous with prefab buildings for years has been at the frontline since mid February delivering many of the emergency structures They began by erecting assessment pods and isolation units in hospital car parks and they are now working on the government\u2019s national programme of mortuaries \u201cWe were contacted by the commercial directorate of the Cabinet Office asking what could we do around \u2018storage buildings\u2019 \u201d says company director Robert Snook \u201cIt soon became clear what that meant \u201d Portakabin has form in refrigerated storage with previous prefab modules being erected to store everything from exotic orchid bulbs to fine wines The morgues\u2019 racking and shelving systems however were a new challenge The bulk of the firm\u2019s work to date has been in delivering large amounts of overspill space for hospitals so wards with lower risk patients could be relocated to free up more space for those with Covid in the main hospital buildings Snook says this is all business as usual for a company that is used to rapid response having delivered an emergency hospital to the Falkland Islands during the war in the 1980s and built an entire secondary school in nine weeks following the Grenfell Tower fire \u201cThis is all standard stuff for us \u201d says Snook \u201cThe main challenge has actually been getting our hands on enough FFP3 face masks for our workers to wear in the factory \u201d While companies such as Portakabin have been supplying standard modular shells as usual with the factories working full pelt some situations have required more bespoke solutions One of the most technically demanding of the temporary structures so far has been the transformation of the ExCel convention centre at the Docklands area in east London into an emergency field hospital NHS Nightingale ultimately capable of holding patients The gargantuan exhibition halls have hosted a diverse range of functions in the past from the Crufts dog show to international arms fairs but this incarnation has stretched the building\u2019s flexible nature to the limit A queue at a drive through testing station for NHS staff at the Wembley Ikea Photograph Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Completed in nine days it has \u2013 like every other part of the national response to Covid \u2013 been worked out on the fly The location was settled on in mid March after other large sports halls and warehouses were considered The ventilation system is equipped to handle large numbers of people the floors are riddled with mechanical service boxes and there is a readily available supply of modular partitions and teams of technicians used to mounting exhibitions overnight \u201cThe strategy was all about using as much of the existing infrastructure as possible \u201d says James Hepburn of BDP architects who led on the design team for the project \u201cIt was clear on day one how difficult procurement was going to be as a lot of factories were shutting down We used the exhibition partitions with a bit of extra stiffening to create the bedheads then ran the power water drainage and medical gas in a long service run behind mirroring the bed bays on either side \u201d Visibility between the bays was key given that the doctors will each be charged with many more patients than usual Contractors transform the ExCel centre in east London into the NHS Nightingale hospital in late March Photograph Stefan Rousseau AP The site became a hour production line coordinated by army personnel seeing vinyl floor laid partitions erected and teams of electricians assembling prefabricated dado trunking to be screwed to the bedheads as soon as they were up The central boulevard between the conference halls usually home to networking delegates has been transformed into a controlled zone where medics don and doff protective clothing while the waterfront cafes have become their much needed rest areas Of course there is a mortuary too \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that when the army sets up a camp with a field hospital one of first things they do is build the mortuary \u201d says Hepburn \u201cThere\u2019s a psychological element to it \u2013 if you\u2019re in a war situation knowing that that side of it is dealt with is actually quite reassuring \u201d Learning from their experiences BDP has produced a \u201chow to\u201d guide drawn in the clear diagrammatic style of an Ikea furniture building manual to help other projects Similar emergency hospitals are under way in Bristol Harrogate Birmingham and Manchester Despite the rushed intensity of the process might the whole experience offer some lessons for the future \u201cIf someone asked you to design a hospital like this you would normally say you need six months and an enormous team of carefully selected individuals not a group of people thrown together over a weekend \u201d says Hepburn \u201cHere there wasn\u2019t the usual \u2018design responsibility matrix\u2019

embarrassment and fear \u201d Other extortion tactics include bomb threats and hitman schemes \u201cpay \u2018x\u2019 amount in dollars or a bomb will go off in your office or you will be killed\u201d or monetary demands from authorities \u201cpay \u2018x\u2019 or you will go to prison\u201d Once clicked on these scams can infect computers with malware ransomware and trojans for further information stealing \u201cAt that point the hacker has access to your computer \u201d Ahmad adds \u201cThey can track every keystroke that you are doing dependent on what has been embedded \u201d CREDENTIAL STUFFING ON THE RISE Email addresses and their associated passwords are bread and butter for hackers says Claudiu Popa a certified security and privacy risk advisor and CEO of Informatica Corporation Why Because he explains they are the gateway to a victim\u2019s virtual identity potentially providing access to several accounts devices and online activity at once \u201c Personal emails and their passwords are by far the most valuable identity element because they are used to not just uniquely identify you on the entire internet \u201d he says \u201cbut are also used to validate accounts track your location and devices determine your behavioural patterns and preferences store communications for years or decades and generally represent the centre of your world \u201d The activity\u2014known as credential stuffing\u2014involves hackers accessing email addresses usernames passwords and data recovery information including security questions while targeting multiple accounts email accounts banking profiles and platforms social media \u201cThat trend is on the rise because people reuse the same passwords across a number of sites and large data breaches are taking place more frequently \u201d says Popa SUBJECT HEADING SUCCESS Tried and tested there a few common email subject headings still to be on alert for These include those toned with urgency such as \u201cRight now or else \u201d tempting questions demanding action such as \u201cReach more customers now\u201d or those piquing curiosity such as \u201cThree quick ways to make extra a week\u201d shares Popa More nuanced email scams include those mimicking service providers such as banks retailers mobile device providers or travel companies adds Ahmad Users can be easily duped as the emails look authentic and include standard operating procedures such as order and password reset confirmations notifications of suspicious account activity and so on \u201cIt looks legitimate The graphs are good There aren\u2019t any spelling mistakes in it \u201d he says \u201cYou would be surprised how many people will have a hard time figuring out that the email is not legitimate \u201d Cybercriminals are also piquing our interest via email subject headings reports Symantec by using our former passwords phone numbers and emails extracted from data breach dumps FOOL ME ONCE So with articles like this one sharing the latest from experts why do we open these emails let alone click the links in them They\u2019re better drafted more manipulative and catchy says Ahmad Familiarity causes us to act \u201cHuman curiosity is what it is \u201d he says \u201cThey draft their subject line with a hook that would encourage you to click or at least look at the email more \u201d More sophisticated approaches such as mixing richer data the use of AI techniques to bypass defences such as two factor authentication and more computer power are also at play adds Popa \u201cScams tricks and fraud have been a part of human civilization and society forever There\u2019s nothing new here not the Nigerian Letter scam nor the cup and ball tricks of street peddlers \u201d says Popa \u201cWithout knowing about particular scams it is difficult to anticipate them You would have to invent every kind of trick in order to be able to prevent being scammed \u201d IN YOUR HANDS Protect yourself with CPA Canada\u2019s practical guide to keeping your money and personal information in your own hands or heed tips in real time during its fraud protection workshop ON ALERT TO PROTECT YOURSELF When it comes to personal email accounts the biggest threat is identity theft experts say Cybersecurity experts Imran Ahmad and Claudiu Popa offer suggestions to protect yourself While this may seem obvious we might need a reminder Filter risky websites using tools such as OpenDNS advises Popa and ignore sketchy emails and clickbait Use separate log ins Avoid using Facebook or Google credentials to log into another account when offered \u201cThough it is a bit more time consuming try not to use it because if you get those credentials compromised the hacker potentially has access to multiple different accounts \u201d says Ahmad Use two factor authentication When it\u2019s offered use it says Ahmad It\u2019s an added assurance for protecting your personal data Manage passwords An obvious one but regularly update your passwords and use something more complex that\u2019s tough to crack reminds Ahmad Avoid using one password for multiple accounts adds Popa That way he says if a site that you use gets breached your other accounts won\u2019t get hit Clear out your email box Get rid of old or unnecessary invoices receipts statements or anything containing personal information if you don\u2019t need them \u201cYou will be surprised how many emails you have that contain personal information \u201d warns Ahmad \u201cNow imagine some third party going in and doing those searches on your behalf It\u2019s very attractive \u201d", "page_url": "https://www.cpacanada.ca/en/news/canada/2019-12-13-personal-email-scams", "label": 1, "score": "210705_news_152989"}, "210705_news_177989": {"page_id":

of Homeland Security the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\u2019s CISA mission is to mitigate risk to our nation\u2019s infrastructure both real and cyber They also help establish which jobs are critical to our nation Fortunately there are many military jobs that easily cross over to the civilian sector The value of knowing this information is that if you are thinking of joining the military and are looking to train in a field that you can use when back in the civilian world or are thinking of getting out and are trained in one of these fields it will make getting a rewarding job easier These jobs are critical to our nation\u2019s safety and security not only during times of crisis but even when the threat is low This article examines eight critical fields that pair well with military specialties Communications Being able to communicate both electronically verbally and written is critical to any nation We are seeing the value of communicating right now during our pandemic crisis From Federal agencies interacting with each other and with private business to the regular press conferences to let the public know what is the current state of things it is easy to see the value of communicating and why it must continue regardless of the threat Network management public relations and information technology are always in demand in the civilian world HealthCare Diagnosis and treatment are basically the same whether you are working on a military member or a civilian Dieticians physician assistants dental assistants laboratory technicians and more are all in high demand in the civilian world Infectious disease experts and front line health workers are especially valuable right now that is no more apparent than in our current situation And make no mistake about it another pandemic will come along at some point in the future if the past is any indication Logistics and Supply Chains It is the farmers that feed the nation but that food gets nowhere without loggies arranging warehousing distribution and delivery to get that food to the people This is another field where military function easily crosses over to the civilian world Transportation is a big part of the supply chain From flying cargo and food stuffs to moving goods by rail to truck drivers like the Army 88M Transportation Specialists getting goods and products to their final destination all play a critical part in this supply chain In the case of 88Ms and similar MOSs on the other military branches all that is usually required to cross over is obtaining a CDL and passing a DOT medical clearance Some companies may also require a short driver training course specific to how they do business And it is the same with pilots and locomotive engineers \u2013 most transportation MOSs easily cross over with minimal additional training required Alternative Energy From nuclear to wind geothermal and solar all alternative energy sources are trending upward as our nation continues to try to reduce its carbon footprint From the Navy\u2019s sailors that are trained in the operation of nuclear reactors to many of the fields located in Vertical Combat Engineer Units skilled specialists and technicians in these units are in high demand in the civilian world as our nation continues to drift toward energy sources other than fossil fuels Manufacturing There is increasing need for welders machinists and other trades like people on assembly lines Besides skills in these fields the MOSs of combat engineers weapons repairers and logistic planners are all employed in the manufacturing field First Responders Right now is a boom time for people in this field From firefighters to military police to emergency medical responders \u2013 especially EMTs and paramedics \u2013 military training in these fields crosses over nicely to the civilian world with minimum ramp up time or training Mechanical Maintainers It is a fact that equipment needs scheduled and routine maintenance to keep operating optimally Because the military is more maintenance conscious than many non military organizations it is an easy transition for trained individuals to crosswalk into civilian jobs in this broad field Whether it is keeping boilers running in manufacturing plants to keeping equipment moving like farm machinery long haul trucks planes or automobiles there is a place for everyone regardless of their mechanical talents Fresh and Wastewater Management Fresh potable water is not only essential to human survival it is a resource needed by most businesses large and small And wastewater must be handled correctly to prevent disease outbreaks and contamination of our fresh water supply Consequently because of its importance water \u2013 fresh and waste \u2013 is one field high on the CISA\u2019s radar As would be expected plumbing jobs are at the heart of this field But there are other jobs just as important in this field like pipefitters welders water systems maintainers utilities maintenance managers and like jobs typically found in commercial applications Another sector in the water management area that concerns the CISA are dams on our water systems like rivers and lakes Because dams supply water to towns and businesses and in the case of hydroelectric dams generate electricity into the grid they are a critical part of our infrastructure The Army Corps of Engineers built and manages about dams in the U S But of these dams are at least years old more than half are over years old Between replacing many of these aging structures at some time in the future to maintaining and repairing the rest of them in the present people skilled in engineering construction and maintenance of these vertical structures are and will continue to be in demand While the job market is depressed at the moment because of the coronavirus pandemic the economy and the jobs to support it will come back The best thing to do now in the meantime is to prepare for future changes in your job field by using your GI Bill to supplement your training so that when opportunity presents itself you are the one best prepared and ready to grab it The term Military Occupational Specialty MOS is the job title used by the Army and Marines to describe each of their jobs The Navy and Coast Guard use the term \u201cRating \u201d while the Air Force uses Air Force Specialty Code AFSC instead of MOS However all these terms are interchangeable", "page_url": "https://news.clearancejobs.com/2020/04/24/military-specialties-that-match-with-critical-civilian-jobs/",

COVID-19", "text": "MCAS FUTENMA Okinawa Japan \u2013 For Staff Sgt Michael P Burnham and Sgt Blaine E Garcia a trailer sized workspace filled with sweltering heat and the constant whine of over a dozen machines running at full speed is simply the setting for just another day This day however sees these leaders bringing 3D printing to the fight for 1st Marine Aircraft Wing using their manufacturing skills against COVID For Burnham who originally joined the Marine Corps as a machinist working with ground ordnance and Garcia who started his career working on jet engines the process of 3D printing has become less of an unexpected turn in their service and more of a passion Garcia alone has several 3D printers of his own once used for hobbies and now put into the effort by III Marine Expeditionary Force to print the frames for thousands of masks and face shields Posters surround the machines churning away each one highlighting a success story for 3D printing in 1st MAW and an example of the sort of additive manufacturing both Marines have spent years perfecting Today Burnham and Garcia have put their experience into the fight against the COVID virus In their workspace on Marine Corps Air Station Futenma the two have turned their workspace ordinarily used for 3D printing parts for aviation maintenance into a PPE factory The goal of the overall effort Burnham explained is to reduce the need for medical grade masks and respirators by providing an alternative supply of frames for masks and face shields to Marines and Sailors assigned to III MEF and its supporting units particularly those directly engaged in first line medical care and screening The plastic frames being printed Burnham said started as 3D models on a computer designed with input from medical professionals and incorporating open source ideas from others in the 3D printing community Once the design is settled a program \u201cslices\u201d the model into a series of programs for the 3D printer which can then assemble a complete object from up to thousands of layers of two dimensional patterns formed by cooling jets of molten plastic The mask frames themselves can be created in a number of different plastic materials and create a complete mask using elastic bands cords or other fasteners along with an easily washable and readily available cloth cover The plastic frame creates a seal around an individual\u2019s mouth and nose as demonstrated by Garcia wearing the end result amidst the 3D printers at work The face shields are a more complicated product also developed in concert with the U S Naval Hospital on Okinawa Garcia has designed the face shield frames himself with hospital public health officials providing quality assurance \u201cWe start with a number of different prototypes \u201d he explained demonstrating a number of designs that public health experts had directed alterations to \u201cWe look at all the ideas and each prototype goes through the QA process \u201d The final design he said is deliberately simple but effective an arc shaped piece of plastic with a series of pegs and hooks along the outside edge \u201cWe send the frames to the hospital \u201d Garcia explained demonstrating the process of making a face shield with the frames using a plastic sheet protector \u201cThey\u2019ll clean them and use a plastic similar to the overhead transparencies they use in schools with holes punched in them to fit over the knobs on the front \u201d MALS will be producing the face shield frames going forward as part of III MEF\u2019s overall effort with other elements producing mask frames at a similar rate beyond the already produced by MALS This is nothing new from Garcia\u2019s considerable experience in the burgeoning field \u201cAny part that we print for an aircraft goes through reviews by engineers and experts \u201d Garcia said \u201censuring that the parts fit the tolerances needed and can stand up to the conditions Once that\u2019s done it\u2019s available to every Marine and Sailor who can print \u201d allowing the services to rapidly disseminate the designs that make the cut This division of labor with different units producing parts and medical personnel taking the mass produced frames for masks and face shields and overseeing the distribution allows the MALS team to focus on rapid and sustained production 3D printing Garcia noted has a longer lead time initially than simply ordering parts that are in stock but once the initial design is finished it allows for faster cheaper and more responsive delivery of parts \u2013 and it allows entirely new items to be created from scratch in remote conditions Around the clock Burnham and Garcia oversee the process of production Maintaining their distance from each other in both time and space the two Marines work in shifts with Garcia laboring to keep the morning\u2019s mask and face shield production going and Burnham arriving in the afternoon after Garcia has departed to remove the finished products from their print beds and begin the process yet again Despite the long hours Burnham emphasized that 3D printing is not necessarily labor intensive once production has begun \u201cWe print them in stacks \u201d Burnham said against the backdrop of another set of mask frames being printed \u201cMost of the time if there\u2019s a mistake it\u2019s in the first layer so we can tell right away if we need to stop the machine and reposition \u201d From there the frames can be left alone the workspace growing noticeably hot inside as a dozen nozzles spread heated plastic out in an exacting pattern After hours the frames are ready to remove from the printer and separate into individual items \u2013 and at two to four stacks of ten mask frames each per machine this adds up quickly allowing any similarly appointed workspace to create over mask frames per day This output according to Burnham is a process that can be kept up To accomplish it the machine\u2019s print head moves from side to side while the print bed itself the large plate upon which the object is printed moves forward and back Each layer of the object is painstakingly assembled by the minute programmed motions of the print head feeding a heated stream of molten plastic precisely into place The smaller machines print more slowly but use a smaller filament allowing for finer detail to be captured The entryway to Garcia and Burnham\u2019s workspace is decorated by evidence of this fine detail with everything from rocket parts and ornate twisting test pieces to minutely detailed decorations arrayed on tables in 3D printed wood metal and plastic Even the fixtures within the workspace are 3D printed with the handles suspending first aid kits and most plastic parts of the 3D printers themselves bearing the fine striations that mark a 3D printed product \u201cWith 3D printing \u201d Garcia said \u201cyou\u2019re really limited only by your

customers and community the first of what will be regular quarterly posts At the time I reflected on the fact that we were entering a new decade a period where tremendous technological forces are reshaping the world Since then we have entered a new era and societies in every corner of the globe face a historic challenge We are reminded that for all of our advances as a civilization nature can be a powerful force which we must adapt and innovate around Every Friday since I started in October I\u2019ve sent the company an email and brief \u201cFireside Chat\u201d video with my observations on the week and our progress as we transform into a leading SaaS company Since we went fully remote in early March these company wide communications have provided updates on how we are navigating the COVID pandemic Below are some of the thoughts I shared T his is a key moment in our company\u2019s history as the whole world is dealing with significant uncertainty Know that you are not alone We are facing this situation together Reflect on other challenging times as it relates to your life and how it ultimately passed and made you into who you are as a person today I\u2019m confident that with your help and daily leadership we will figure it out solve the various problems in front of us with an agile and growth mindset and WE WILL come out of this crisis as a stronger company My ask is that you stay focused on living our core values and actively connect with your team our community and customers I want to share the same sentiment with our community our customers and the millions of developers and technologists who visit our network from around the world Let\u2019s all continue to take care of each other Since late February our newly formed leadership team has met three times a week in COVID related standups In these meetings we ensure that we are evaluating all available data problem solving with an agile approach and making timely decisions on a variety of topics We cover everything from the health and safety of our employees to how we can best support our community given our remote DNA to how to best serve our customers with our SaaS collaboration products This has been a tough week at Stack Overflow and taking care of each other is more important than ever right now Like companies large and small we have had to make difficult choices in order to reflect the market conditions This week we reduced our global workforce by approximately Most of the affected employees were furloughed except for employees and contractors in regions where furloughs were unfortunately not an option These actions primarily affected sales and customer success teams within our Talent business which is dependent on the hiring environment We made these decisions with great care and only after assessing and leveraging all other options We\u2019ve paused all non critical hiring suspended our travel budget for all of Q2 and Q3 and cut marketing and software costs significantly Reducing our headcount was a painful but necessary decision of no fault of the employees affected and one that I take full accountability for as the CEO We did this in order to ensure that we can serve our customers and community in the long run Despite the impact to our Talent business we are seeing significant growth in our core SaaS business Stack Overflow for Teams and our Advertising business Our Stack Overflow for Teams collaboration SaaS business is seeing strong interest from enterprises and mid market companies to raise their remote and distributed team preparedness via collaboration and knowledge sharing software Our Advertising business continues to show strength As the 41st most visited website in the word we attract over million unique visitors every month and companies want to showcase developer and technologist centric products in an era when technology is top of mind So our priority moving forward is to rapidly accelerate the growth of these businesses in order to welcome our colleagues back as soon as possible and in order to help developers technologists and teams around the world achieve new levels of collaboration and knowledge sharing I heard some wise words recently with a crisis like this you can\u2019t go around the problem you have to go through it As a new leadership team and rapidly transforming organization it\u2019s been inspiring to see us come together in a very challenging time and be highly transparent in our approach to move the organization forward Given that I want to focus a bit on what we are doing as a company and community to respond to the COVID pandemic Core Values Mission and Vision With COVID now a world wide pandemic it\u2019s a moment in our history where humanity will step up yet again and come out stronger Our newly defined core values have allowed our company to stay grounded as we navigate these challenging times Adopt a customer first mindset Be flexible and inclusive Be transparent Empower people to deliver outstanding results Keep community at our center Learn share and grow Our mission of helping write the script of the future\u2014by serving developers and all technologists\u2014guides all our initiatives across the company and is so critical during this pivotal time in history The community of users across the entire network of Stack Exchange sites and the content that they author and curate serve as the foundation for all of our products and highlight the importance of having active and engaged users on a platform that encourages easier and more comprehensive knowledge sharing and collaboration Companies and organizations around the world are rapidly accelerating their own digital transformation journeys and Stack Overflow is at the heart of that transformation We\u2019re humbled to play a meaningful part in that transformation as we help solve the most difficult technology problems through our ecosystem of technical communities and SaaS collaboration and knowledge sharing products Community While commuting and socializing has dipped in recent months traffic to a number of our Stack Exchange sites has surged during this period a reflection of people\u2019s need for great answers to pressing questions Beyond Stack Overflow and our technical Stack Exchange websites like DevOps ServerFault for SysAdmin and Cloud related topics Software Engineering some of our other Stack Exchange websites are growing for obvious reasons Our Biology and Medical Science sites have seen a wave of interest as people seek to understand the nature of viruses and what we can do to stop them And there has been a massive jump in traffic on Meta Academia up as students and teachers work to navigate this new world of remote learning It\u2019s also a testament to the Academia community which responded by putting together an amazing list of resources for people whose academic workflow has been disrupted by COVID We are seeing similar efforts across numerous Stack Exchanges as digital communities that have existed for years\u2014or in some cases over a decade\u2014come together in this moment of crisis As these groups discussed how to tackle the new challenges facing employees families individuals and organizations they created a new chat room where users from across the Stack Exchange Network can come to to discuss issues or emotions related to the ongoing crisis In addition we have worked on initial experiments aimed at adding potential content sharing and integration between Stack Overflow and other technical sites on the network to reflect the converging technology environment as it relates to full stack engineering Cloud and DevOps Along with the surge in traffic to our sites we have also seen an encouraging lift in new users signing up for accounts You can see the spike and continued lift that has been happening in Product Despite our focus on navigating COVID I do want to use this quarterly letter to highlight a number of positive notable product releases we made during the first quarter of These are the building blocks that will help our company community and customers to weather this storm and to rebuild when it passes As many regions around the globe have asked citizens to shelter at home and companies focus on business continuity there has been a huge spike in demand for collaboration and remote work tools\u2014both synchronous and asynchronous We have seen this change reflected in a spike in demand for Stack Overflow for Teams our leading asynchronous collaboration and knowledge sharing SaaS product As a highly remote company we have been using Stack Overflow for Teams at Stack Overflow for many years\u2014to rapidly launch new products and features by breaking down silos across Product Engineering Sales and Marketing March was our best month ever for Stack Overflow for Teams deal volume in the history of the four year old product with growth hitting of our goal and with major enterprises joining the fold This week we signed a landmark multi year Stack Overflow for Teams customer agreement the largest commercial agreement in the history of our year old company with one of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions to enable collaboration and knowledge sharing across users in their global enterprise We have heard from many customers that Stack Overflow for Teams has become a critical asynchronous collaboration tool for their companies as they shifted their workforce entirely remote during this pandemic \u201cHaving a well run online community where Unqork no code software creators can share knowledge and seek out expert advice is critical to our growth and success We\u2019re finding the Stack Overflow for Teams platform particularly valuable with the current remote work environment \u201d said Olga Gomonova Unqork\u2019s Head of Client Enablement \u201cStack Overflow has helped make it even easier to create applications without code and our Stack Overflow community has become an important part of our enablement and employee onboarding processes as well as our overall knowledge management strategy \u201d We also made the basic tier of Stack Overflow for Teams free until at least the middle of this summer It was the right thing to do for big and mid sized companies that are struggling to go remote and for companies of every size facing business continuity challenges Within the hundreds of companies that are leveraging extended trials of Stack Overflow for Teams we were especially excited and encouraged by the hospitals and healthcare and telemedicine companies that signed up With so many new customers of all kinds one of the key things we want to do is make sure that the products we are building integrate seamlessly with developers\u2019 and technologists\u2019 existing workflow to ensure high levels of productivity In the first quarter we announced new integrations with Github Jira and Microsoft Teams On the public platform side we have made a number of important updates We released a beta version of a feature that will give users more control of what they experience on our network by allowing them to report ads they don\u2019t like and we launched version of our Unfriendly Robot which automatically flags unwelcoming comments We made it possible for users to follow questions and answers that they did not author giving folks an easy way to stay up to date with changes to posts that they are interested in We are excited to share plans for a long awaited overhaul to review queues And we shipped the first in a series of changes to the \u201cclose question\u201d experience that we hope will make life easier for moderators and more pleasant for users Teresa Dietrich our Chief Product Officer published the Q2 edition of our public community roadmap A few highlights We have finished the process of creating the first Pro Tempore Moderator Council We plan to update the Moderator Reinstatement policy in May to potentially include the Moderator Council\u2019s proposed involvement in the process Our Community Managers have been hard at work creating content for moderator training which we have shared for feedback on the Mods Teams instance The plan is to incorporate the feedback and then select and implement a platform for delivery of the training which should launch in May In June we plan on running a Community thon event that will encourage and provide guidance for all Stack Overflow employees of all experience levels on the network to spend time using our sites posting content and interacting with the Community And of course when it comes to changes to our Stack Overflow public site we introduced a feature that has long been among our most requested the ability to view Stack Overflow in dark mode This feature has proved incredibly popular delivering our best month of blog traffic ever and led to a significant boost in the number of people signing up for new Stack Overflow accounts Along with our roadmap we have had in person meetings with several veteran moderators and learned a lot We recently had a pair of moderators on the podcast to share what they are seeing in their community We hope to continue this kind of positive dialogue with our community During this trying time we have seen record traffic to our blog and podcast and we have doubled the number of podcasts and newsletters released each week to try and share important information and stay in touch with current events as the crisis continues Later this month we will launch the results of our Stack Overflow Developer Survey Thank you to over people who took this year\u2019s survey I know you\u2019re anxious to dig into the findings COVID Partnerships We recently announced that Stack Overflow is forging new partnerships to help tackle the COVID crisis We are supporting IBM by helping to promote and judge their annual Call For Code a hackathon which will work to build tools for citizens companies and government agencies We have also featured IBM staffers on our podcast and in our newsletter who are working to help educate coders in COBOL a year old programming language that is now in high demand from government agencies trying to meet unprecedented demand for unemployment insurance We are partnering with the World Health Organization WHO to highlight some of their soon to launch COVID technologies and platforms within our blog newsletter and podcast We are also continuing to create content that is useful for anyone looking for work right now Whether it\u2019s a guide for learning to work asynchronously handling remote interviews or a list of companies that offer free online training and certification We\u2019re sharing that content with individuals and organizations who are going through tough times and partnering with organizations like Pursuit to share best practices for new and recent coders on finding work during this difficult time Moving Forward It has been nearly two months since New York City where Stack Overflow is headquartered mandated shelter in place Since then so much has changed so many have suffered and so many have shown incredible courage and selflessness in battling COVID and to save the lives of those infected We are beginning to see glimmers of hope Countries and cities that were badly impacted have started to flatten the curve Scientists and researchers are pushing vaccines into early trials tests that can be done rapidly and at scale are going into production and companies large and small are finding ways to adapt to this new way of working The COVID pandemic is a reminder that we are all connected as inhabitants of this planet and that human nature is to persevere in the face of even the most extreme adversity I want to thank our employees who have demonstrated tremendous initiative collaborated and worked tirelessly to support and serve our customers and community through this difficult time I know that the road ahead will continue to be hard for many but I feel confident that humanity will recover We will use technology to break down barriers come closer together and find better days ahead I\u2019m optimistic because I\u2019ve seen every day that we are stronger as a global community than we are as individuals and that we all have the capacity to adapt and move forward I believe this moment will ultimately teach us that we are resilient together We appreciate hearing your thoughts and feedback in the comments below Update A mention of Academia was changed to Meta Academia where

Technology JCTD Unmanned Logistics Systems Aerial ULS A Demonstration Near Earth\u2019s technology offers obstacle avoidance for safe flight and landing enabling reliable cargo delivery in dynamic environments In collaboration with the Army and Marines from September active duty Army soldiers and Marines used Near Earth\u2019s technology to safely execute resupply missions in an operational demonstration at Fort AP Hill Virginia The demonstration ended year of the year JCTD program Joe Fagan ULS A Operational Manager\u2019s describes the significance of the achievement \u201cThis was the first opportunity for the military users to interact with the ULS A capability Whether they were uploading autonomy packages downloading data or operating as safety pilots I was continually impressed with the breadth and depth of the Near Earth Autonomy Team \u201d Robert McKinney Technical Manager for the Unmanned Logistics Systems Air ULS A JCTD Marine Corp Warfighter Lab said \u201cFrom a logistics standpoint the Marines are looking to deliver small to medium weight supplies like water beans and ammunition to forward operating bases We\u2019re looking at fully autonomous rather than just manually operated vehicles Without a man in the loop losses are minimal and there are no humans at risk \u201d In time autonomous resupply will support ground convoys and manned aircraft that today are at risk of attack when bringing warfighters the supplies they need to conduct their missions Master Gunnery Sergeant Ulrich said \u201cWe can apply this capability and really help out the warfighter I see a lot of applications in delivering in austere environments In this way we\u2019ll keep trucks off the road we\u2019ll keep Marines off the road and use technology to our advantage so that our troops can get what they need when they need it \u201d The technology being used by warfighters marks a historic milestone in bringing autonomous mobility into reality for the US military American defense leadership is actively exploring innovative new technologies that will give them a significant advantage over less advanced adversaries Master Gunnery Sergeant Ulrich continued \u201cI think the Marines are adapting to the platforms because it is generationally relevant The Marines of today look at it as something that enables them to do their job in a streamlined way The training is minimal enough to allow them to adapt quickly It\u2019s able to help them stay out of the firefight themselves and they\u2019ve responded by executing almost flawlessly I see the future of ULS A eventually evolving into a medium size platform that\u2019s able to provide a diverse distribution portfolio Within the JCTD year two and three we\u2019ll be looking at bigger faster stronger platforms meaning more battery life more distribution capability and overall increasing the ability to keep the warfighter in the fight \u201d The military plans to continue collaborating with Near Earth Autonomy to expand their autonomous resupply capabilities About Near Earth Autonomy Near Earth\u2019s technology allows aircraft to autonomously take off fly and land safely with or without GPS Their solutions enable aerial mobility and inspection applications for partners in the commercial and defense sectors Near Earth bridges the gap between aerospace and robotics with complete systems

set up take down and operate a United Nations standard level hospital through the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership program The program funded by the State Department helps African nations enhance peacekeeping and security capabilities Of these four partner nations three are now deploying their level hospitals as part of their response to the COVID pandemic We are proud to stand by our partners as we battle this deadly virus in Africa and around the globe Air Force Lt Gen James Vechery Africom s deputy commander said As we work shoulder to shoulder it is exciting to see our African partners putting the capabilities we ve developed over the past few years to such great use during this global pandemic It is our hope that the support we provide to our partners enables them to lessen human suffering and strengthen their nations their people and the global community Air Force Col Krystal Murphy Africom s deputy command surgeon The hospitals are one example of Africom efforts to assist African partners to enhance their medical capabilities and pandemic response Programs such as tactical combat casualty care training medical readiness exercises and conferences focused on pandemic response efforts all demonstrate the long term investment by the command Ghana Senegal and Uganda independently decided to deploy their hospitals in support of their national response said Air Force Maj Mohamed Diallo Africom international health specialist Senegal and Uganda are using the hospitals as overflow facilities for existing hospitals We are going to start treating people Lt Col Henry Obbo Uganda Land Forces spokesman said It s just put here in case the means of health might require additional facilities Ghana which has nearly confirmed cases of COVID is using the facility to treat those affected by the virus Now more than ever the United States is pleased to work together with the government armed forces and people of Ghana U S Ambassador to Ghana Stephanie Sullivan said This mobile hospital will directly serve those most in need Together we will emerge from this stronger and more united Sullivan echoed Ghanaian President Akufo Addo s call for all Ghanaians and residents of Ghana to stay home as much as possible as it s one of the most effective ways to combat the pandemic and flatten the curve Each hospital package includes shelters with a total of square feet of shelter space consisting of an intensive care unit a radiology unit and beds While these hospitals were originally designed to support Senegalese soldiers on the battlefield the Senegalese military has now deployed one of these hospitals and personnel to the city of Touba to assist in the emergency response to the COVID outbreak said U S Ambassador to Senegal Tulinabo S Mushingi Combined with the support from other U S agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U S Agency for International Development known as USAID these contributions have greatly strengthened Senegal s ability to respond to the COVID threat and demonstrate the strength of the strong year U S Senegalese partnership the ambassador added The effort highlights a whole of government approach aimed at ensuring African partners are educated resourced and supported to contain the spread of the virus Africom officials said This program and the medical capabilities it

Solutions Inc ASI has been awarded a SBIR Phase I grant from the U S Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Ground Vehicles Systems Center formerly TARDEC to develop a Deep Learning DL architecture that will support sensor fusion in environments with limited or no GPS \u201cEnvironmental sensing today typically includes cameras LiDAR and radar \u201d said Jeff Ferrin CTO of ASI \u201cEach of these devices has a specific purpose but not all of them work well in every situation For example cameras are great at collecting high resolution color information but do not provide much useful information in the dark \u201d In addition to the challenges faced by cameras in poorly lit or degraded visual environments LiDAR and radar sensors also have limitations LiDAR performs well in most light conditions but may yield false positives in heavy rain fog snow or dust due to its use of light spectrum wavelengths Radar usually penetrates these degraded visual environments but often lacks spatial resolution \u201cASI\u2019s goal is to design a deep learning architecture that fuses information from LiDAR radar and cameras \u201d said Ferrin \u201cWe plan to build upon machine learning techniques we have already developed for LiDAR data \u201d Deep learning is a branch of artificial intelligence and machine learning that allows valuable information to be extracted from large volumes of data Cameras are often used in deep learning models because of their high output of information in regularly sampled data structures The case is different for LiDAR and radar Naturally these two sensor types do not provide regularly sampled data making it difficult to formulate problems using current deep learning frameworks This gap in current research efforts \u2013 deep learning for LiDAR and radar \u2013 is the focus of this grant Improved utilization of data from multiple devices can paint a more accurate picture of a vehicle\u2019s surroundings keeping it safer and making it more efficient The details of the grant solicitation state \u201cIt is anticipated that harnessing a wide variety of sensors altogether will benefit the autonomous vehicles by providing a more general and robust self driving system especially for navigating in different types of challenging weather environments road conditions and traffic \u201d \u201cIn the last few years we have seen a growing need in the world of robotics to advance industry capabilities in machine learning deep learning and other artificial intelligence algorithms to improve performance in these challenging environments \u201d said Ferrin Details of the Phase I grant awarded to ASI include developing a deep learning architecture that will support sensors that are not vision based such as radar and LiDAR along with supporting sensor fusion ASI is required to demonstrate the feasibility of the deep learning architecture in a simulation environment including a road following system that controls an

Marine Corps Sgt Blaine E Garcia a trailer sized workspace filled with sweltering heat and the constant whine of more than a dozen machines running at full speed is simply the setting for just another day This day however involves bringing 3D printing to the fight for the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing as they use their manufacturing skills against COVID For Burnham who originally served as a machinist working with ground ordnance and Garcia who started his career working on jet engines the process of 3D printing has become less of an unexpected turn in their service and more of a passion Garcia has several 3D printers of his own once used for hobbies and now put into the effort by the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Force to print the frames for thousands of masks and face shields Posters that surround the machines as they churn away highlight a success story for 3D printing in the 1st MAW and serve as an example of the sort of additive manufacturing that Burnham and Garcia have spent years perfecting Today they have put their experience into the fight against the COVID coronavirus In their workspace on Marine Corps Air Station Futenma on the Japanese island of Okinawa the two have turned their workspace ordinarily used for 3D printing parts for aviation maintenance into a personal protection equipment factory The goal Burnham explained is to reduce the need for medical grade masks and respirators by providing an alternative supply of frames for masks and face shields for Marines and sailors assigned to the 3rd MEF and its supporting units particularly those directly engaged in first line medical care and screening The plastic frames being printed Burnham said started as 3D models on a computer designed with input from medical professionals and incorporating open source ideas from others in the 3D printing community Once the design is settled a program slices the model into a series of programs for the 3D printer which can then assemble a complete object from up to thousands of layers of two dimensional patterns formed by cooling jets of molten plastic The mask frames can be created in different plastic materials and they ll be combined with elastic bands cords or other fasteners along with easily washable and readily available cloth covers to make complete masks The plastic frame creates a seal around the wearer s mouth and nose The face shields are a more complicated product also developed in concert with the U S Naval Hospital on Okinawa Garcia designed the face shield frames with hospital public health officials providing quality assurance We start with a number of different prototypes he explained demonstrating a number of designs for which public health experts had directed alterations We look at all the ideas and each prototype goes through the quality assurance process The final design he said is deliberately simple but effective an arc shaped piece of plastic with a series of pegs and hooks along the outside edge We send the frames to the hospital Garcia said demonstrating the process of making a face shield with the frames using a plastic sheet protector They ll clean them and use a plastic similar to the overhead transparencies they use in schools with holes punched in them to fit over the knobs on the front MALS will be producing the face shield frames going forward as part of the 3rd MEF s overall effort with other elements producing mask frames at a similar rate beyond the already produced Any part these Marines print for an aircraft goes through reviews by engineers and experts Garcia said ensuring that they fit the tolerances needed and can stand up to the conditions Once that s done it s available to every Marine and sailor who can print he added allowing the services to rapidly disseminate the designs that make the cut This division of labor with different units producing parts and medical personnel taking the mass produced frames for masks and face shields and overseeing the distribution allows the MALS team to focus on rapid and sustained production Garcia said noting that 3D printing has a longer lead time initially than simply ordering parts that are in stock But once the initial design is finished he said it allows for faster cheaper and more responsive delivery of parts It also allows entirely new items to be created from scratch in remote conditions Around the clock Burnham and Garcia oversee the process of production Maintaining their distance from each other in both time and space the two Marines work in shifts with Garcia laboring to keep the morning s mask and face shield production going and Burnham arriving after Garcia has departed to remove the finished products from their print beds and begin the process yet again Despite the long hours Burnham emphasized that 3D printing is not necessarily labor intensive once production has begun We print them in stacks he said against the backdrop of another set of mask frames being printed Most of the time if there s a mistake it s in the first layer so we can tell right away if we need to stop the machine and reposition From there the frames can be left alone the workspace growing noticeably hot as a dozen nozzles spread heated plastic out in an exacting pattern After hours the frames are ready to remove from the printer and separate into individual items \u2014 and at two to four stacks of mask frames each per machine this adds up quickly allowing any similarly appointed workspace to create more than mask frames per day This output can be kept up Burnham said The machine s print head moves from side to side while the print bed itself the large plate upon which the object is printed moves forward and back Each layer of the object is painstakingly assembled by the minute programmed motions of the print head feeding a heated stream of molten plastic precisely into place The smaller machines print more slowly but use a smaller filament allowing for finer detail to be captured The entryway to the workspace Garcia and Burnham use is decorated by evidence of this fine detail with everything from rocket parts and ornate twisting test pieces to minutely detailed decorations arrayed on tables in 3D printed wood metal and plastic Even the fixtures within the workspace are 3D printed with the handles suspending first aid kits and most plastic parts of the 3D printers themselves bearing the fine striations that mark a 3D printed product With 3D printing Garcia said you re really limited only by your imagination Marine Corps Lance Cpls Gerardo Cano Madeline

Department of Veterans Affairs on an agreement that increases their ability to share patient medical information and access data from more than civilian hospitals clinics pharmacies and laboratories The VA announced Monday that a health information exchange run jointly by both departments became operable April It will give military and VA physicians access to electronic health records information for patients seen by both government doctors and private providers who have entered into file sharing agreements The system also provides participating private sector doctors and health systems an efficient way to request or access a patient s DoD or VA electronic health records according to a VA release Related These Bases Will Be the Next to Get the New DoD Electronic Health Records System The rollout is part of a bigger health records modernization program by the departments which are adopting an electronic medical records system built by Cerner Government Services that is intended to create a medical record for military personnel that spans their lifetimes from boot camp or officer accessions to death The system called MHS Genesis in the DoD is expected to be fully operational within the Defense Department by The VA which agreed to purchase the same system in is not expected to have it fully implemented until The VA and DoD already had been sharing some medical information with outside providers through their own agreements Information available to providers includes laboratory results medications health histories allergies and occupational health information for employees who are also beneficiaries The new technology comes at a time when both departments are responding to the COVID pandemic with more than patients diagnosed with the novel coronavirus as of Tuesday in both health systems The recent COVID pandemic underlines the importance for clinicians on the front lines to quickly access a patient s health record regardless of where that patient previously received care said Dr Neil Evans interim director of the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization program office in a release The system includes a capability that will allow health networks to access it in the future by agreement with both the VA and DoD For example the departments have already signed an arrangement with CommonWell a community provider network that is expected to give more community providers access to military and veteran patient information in the fall Patients who want to opt out of the file sharing arrangements have several options for doing so with the exception of active duty service members who aren t allowed to opt out Veterans may opt out by completing VA Form which they can download and mail They also can go to a Release of Information Department at the VA facility where they receive care and complete the form Non active duty Tricare beneficiaries can opt out by going to Tricare s website VA officials announced in early February that they were delaying rollout of their electronic health records system while they ensured that the system would work within the VA s current information technology infrastructure Initial deployment at the VA was set to begin in March at the Mann Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane Washington But that has been put on hold during the coronavirus pandemic The DoD also has temporarily suspended the next phase of the MHS Genesis rollout to ensure that military medical providers are focused on pandemic response rather than learning a new medical records system With the new health information

has a phase rollout Phase is complete with Service leavers receiving a recognition card as part of the discharge process Phase is to extend the scheme to existing veterans so that they can more quickly easily and securely prove they served in the UK Armed Forces so they can access the services they need We had hoped to have this in place by the end of but due to the requirement to future proof the scheme so that veterans can access a wider range of benefits the need to safeguard against fraudulent use means this process will take longer Information on how to apply will be released closer to the launch date A new ID card for armed forces veterans which will help them access specialist support and services has started to be issued to service leavers From today any personnel who have left the military since December will automatically be given one of the new ID cards which will allow them to maintain a tangible link to their career in the forces The cards allow veterans to easily verify their service to the NHS their local authority and charities helping them to access support and services where needed All other veterans will be able to apply for a new ID card by the end of this year to mark their time in the armed forces Minister for Defence People and Veterans Tobias Ellwood said We owe a huge debt of gratitude to the ex forces community and we are working hard to ensure they receive the support they deserve These new cards celebrate the great commitment and dedication of those who have served this country and I hope they can provide a further link to ex personnel and the incredible community around them Veterans UK which manages pensions and compensation payments for the armed forces local authorities service charities NHS and GPs will also benefit from the change as they will not have to conduct time consuming checks to identify individual veterans The new ID card is one of three that are available to service leavers Personnel leaving the armed forces are also able to keep their military IDs known as the MOD Form allowing them to maintain their emotional connection with their service Additionally veterans can access a range of discounts through the Defence Discount Service the official MOD endorsed service for the armed forces Last year saw the launch of the Strategy for our Veterans published jointly by the UK Welsh and Scottish Governments which sets out the key areas of support for those who have left the armed forces The consultation closed on Thursday February All relevant Government departments have a responsibility to ensure that the military community is treated fairly and not disadvantaged by their service as part of the Armed Forces Covenant The new ID cards will ensure the process of validating service is as straightforward as possible so that ex forces personnel can access support for issues related to their service quickly where needed The cards will complement the NHS\u2019 commitment to providing specialist health support for veterans in every part of the health service enabling ex service personnel in England Scotland and Wales to access treatment where they have been affected by their service Last year NHS England announced that dedicated mental healthcare services are up and running in every part of the country backed by \u00a3 million of investment with increasing numbers of GPs

distance between other aircraft according to Boeing s website on the project The drones will be able to engage in electronic warfare as well as intelligence reconnaissance and surveillance missions and swap quickly between those roles according to Boeing The aircraft delivered in Sydney on Tuesday is the first of three prototypes Boeing is producing It s also the first aircraft to be designed engineered and manufactured in Australia in more than years Boeing said in a statement Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the drones will protect the country s pricier combat aircraft like F stealth fighters and their pilots in the future and drone production will help with a current crisis fighting the effects of the coronavirus The Loyal Wingman program has helped support around high

space is Cloud Native Buildpacks CNB This is an initiative led by Pivotal and Heroku and contributed to by a wide range of community members and one that the Dokku project has been following fairly closely CNB builds upon the buildpack \u201cstandard\u201d initially developed at Heroku modified at Pivotal for Cloud Foundry and used abused by the gliderlabs herokuish project This post goes over a small amount of history compares buildpack implementations across vendors and talks about the future of buildpacks as they relate to Dokku If you\u2019re using Dokku especially for commercial purposes consider donating to project development via Github Sponsors OpenCollective or Patreon Funds go to general development support and infrastructure costs History Channel Vault When Heroku first launched they provided support for Rack applications which worked fairly well for the budding Ruby community As the Ruby community grew this initial support started to become limiting for their users and thus the Heroku community started reworking their internal tech to be more flexible in functionality they supported and how they launched processes In fact a lot of the fancy features and patterns you\u2019ll see in a modern PaaS factor apps Procfile support etc were first prototyped or promoted by Heroku The process of detecting support building app slugs and releasing the built artifacts was one such initiative Eventually Heroku rebuilt their platform to support alternative programming runtimes as well as community contributed runtimes in what is now known as a buildpacks As time marched on the Cloud Foundry software from Pivotal picked up the buildpack tech This would seem like an overall great thing for the community buildpacks that have better support for enterprise environments and needs would certainly help with adoption in the corporate world but ended up being not as great As there was no real specification for Buildpack technology Pivotal ended up diverging from Heroku\u2019s implementation resulting in Buildpack v2a Heroku style buildpacks Buildpack v2b Cloud Foundry style buildpacks For buildpack authors the standards were largely compatible and it would likely be possible to support both at once but in practice you really only wrote a buildpack for the platform you were using This also meant that new features for say the NodeJs buildpack would need to be implemented twice in order to be supported on these two platforms Additionally the buildpack spec never specified anything about the underlying platform so building a buildpack for Heroku\u2019s platform that depends on some OS level dependency might not work at all when used with Cloud Foundry or vice versa Suffice to say this divergence isn\u2019t great for the community nor great for pushing the technology forward I\u2019ll skip all the details mostly because I don\u2019t know them but the emergence of containers and related technologies enabled the folks at Heroku and Pivotal to combine efforts to on a unified v3 specification which is now CNB Think of it as two mini lion bots coming together to form one super bot Comparing Buildpack tech While the new specification still under development provides a new unified way to create and distribute buildpacks there can still be differences between platforms At this point in time there are actually two different main \u201cbuilders\u201d a collection of buildpacks that folks in the community can use to play around with CNBs both are based on the Bionic stack They do provide slightly different functionality so a comparison between them seems like a reasonable thing to do We\u2019ll also compare CNBs to gliderlabs herokuish which is the main OSS implementation of the buildpack v2a technology At the time of writing Heroku\u2019s builder contains v2a buildpacks with a shim to allow them to run under the v3 specification Additionally there is a possibility that the organizations will collaborate on buildpacks in the future who wants to rebuild the wheel but this is sort of all in the air Please keep this in mind if reading this blog post a few months years from the time of publication Installing dependencies For local testing the CNB project provides the pack cli tool to simulate what would be available in a platform There are related projects for Kubernetes and other tools in the deployment space but pack is great for local testing so we\u2019ll want to install that on a mac with homebrew brew install buildpacks tap pack everywhere else go to the following page and download a release CNB splits buildpacks such that there is a \u201cbuild\u201d base image and a \u201crun\u201d base image Apps are built within the build base image and then the layers are rebased onto the run image for distribution This allows for the distributed image to be smaller in size as well as avoids the need for distribution of compile time dependencies Both of these images need to be available on the machine that is running the build process cloudfoundry docker image pull cloudfoundry cnb latest build docker image pull cloudfoundry run full cnb run heroku docker image pull heroku buildpacks build docker image pull heroku pack run On the herokuish side there is a single image that contains both compile and runtime dependencies You can export a slug from the built image and run that on a system without the installed runtime dependencies but in practice very few people do so docker image pull gliderlabs herokuish latest build and run Neither Cloud Foundry nor Heroku currently publish a Dockerfile for their images so they are still somewhat of a black box It\u2019s also not super clear from the documentation as to what the bionic stack is We can only hope but not assume that these will be published for public recreation in the future Building apps The app we\u2019ll be playing with is the node js getting started app by Heroku You can play around with your own app to see the results also NodeJs is currently supported with both builders as well as the gliderlabs herokuish project With CNB Building an app with CNB is the same regardless of your chosen builder which is nice The following command will build the app in the current directory with the Cloud Foundry builder pack set default builder cloudfoundry cnb latest pack build no pull path app nodejs cloudfoundry latest Whereas utilizing the Heroku builder is not much different pack set default builder heroku buildpacks pack build no pull path app nodejs heroku latest Note that there is a volume cache used for dependencies for both buildpacks At the time of writing this can be computed like so IMAGE app nodejs cloudfoundry latest CACHE VOLUME pack cache echo n index docker io IMAGE sha256sum cut c1 build At the time of writing there isn\u2019t a way to clear out that cache volume so you can use the above method to compute the volume name Please note that clearing this cache volume does not necessarily clear out any app image layers created so this may not do exactly as you\u2019d expect if you are interacting with a remote registry If you are rebuilding an app using pack you\u2019ll notice that there doesn\u2019t appear to be any caching with the Heroku builder This might be a bug due to shim usage and will likely be resolved in the future but for now should expect this to be the case As an aside the buildpacks lifecycle project and therefore pack creates OCI compatible images so tooling that only works with the older Docker Image Specification may fail when using pack built images With Herokuish Building an image with gliderlabs herokuish is a bit more complicated While it is distributed as a binary and a docker image most folks default to using the docker image Some platforms notably Gitlab utilize it via a Dockerfile but this doesn\u2019t allow you to take advantage of build cache The below simulates the patterns used by the pack cli tool use a cache volume this can also be substituted with a directory on disk CACHE VOLUME pack cache echo n index docker io IMAGE sha256sum cut c1 build docker volume rm CACHE VOLUME dev null true docker volume create CACHE VOLUME dev

thing across all platforms Both the CNB images utilize a special launcher process to run your process type for you so all you really need to do is specify that process type cloudfoundry docker container run d p env PORT name app nodejs cloudfoundry app nodejs cloudfoundry latest web Docker log output on that container looks something like the following node js getting started start workspace node index js Listening on Heroku is pretty similar heroku docker container run d p env PORT name app nodejs heroku app nodejs heroku latest web With herokuish you need to execute the process type with the start prefix We also need to specify the USER as this will be used by herokuish to properly set file permissions on the app directory docker container run d p env PORT env USER herokuishuser name app nodejs herokuish app nodejs herokuish latest start web Startup time is a bit longer with herokuish as it will change ownership on files within the app directory Another difference between the two is the environment within which both images run in which we\u2019ll get into next Inspecting the built image Once we have a running app lets inspect our artifact With CNB Executing a command on the CNB backed containers is the same as executing a command with any other docker image Processes are automatically invoked within the correct app environment which is great for one off commands cloudfoundry docker container exec app nodejs cloudfoundry id uid vcap gid vcap groups vcap heroku docker container exec app nodejs heroku id uid heroku gid heroku groups heroku

that PID in the container will depend upon what the buildpack launches Aside from that note there is nothing new with CNB and pack in regards to running commands when compared to normal docker operations so anyone familiar with Docker will feel right at home With Herokuish On the herokuish platform a process must be executed with the exec command as a prefix This will give you an environment that simulates running a command in the heroku stack docker container exec app nodejs herokuish exec id The output of the above command is uid herokuishuser gid herokuishuser groups

with Cloud Native Buildpacks Unfortunately the spec is still evolving though nearing a v1 and the user base is comparatively small If you are a buildpack author or a vendor using buildpack technology now is likely the best time to get involved and raise concerns with the spec and ecosystem That said Dokku has active development towards the addition of CNB to the platform In our case we will likely have it as an experimental feature controlled through the use of environment variables and folks will be able to switch their installations between CNB and Herokuish This will also likely require changes to certain plugins in particular those that interact with the built images but these will hopefully be fairly minimal Long term the plan is to deprecate and eventually remove gliderlabs herokuish support The purpose of the Herokuish project was to allow folks to emulate the Heroku build runtime environment Heroku amongst others will be moving to CNB at some point and already provide a shim for existing buildpacks in the new system So in theory any CNB platform would be able to use that shim any tooling that supports CNB for buildpack support The pack cli tool already provides a way for folks to build and run applications and analogs for most herokuish cli commands Given that pack already exists Can support existing v2a buildpacks via shim Heroku Buildpacks Is actively maintained by the CNB folks and a larger community Can run inside of a container with a socket mounted similar to how herokuish runs The best course of action is for Herokuish to become unsupported once pack hits a stable release It is unlikely that support for Herokuish will continue at that point and only general maintenance work upgrading buildpacks would be performed at that time Long term the project will likely be archived completely in favor of the upstream CNB projects There isn\u2019t any timeline for the above other than experimental support for CNB in Dokku will land at some point in the near future so folks installing and using Dokku won\u2019t need to worry too much about the process Long term there will be a migration path outlined for users and how that impacts users will depend on how much tooling is necessary to shim in the existing ecosystem around buildpacks We hope to keep this minimal but sometimes you need to break some eggs to make an omelette Cloud Native Buildpacks are the future The Dokku project is incredibly excited about Cloud Native Buildpacks and it\u2019s implications for speeding up how we build secure applications and services While the existing community is fairly small the contributors are very dedicated to getting everything just right and we expect that this will be a great boon to users of both Dokku and buildpacks in general If you\u2019d like to have a say in how the CNB initiative develops please feel free to join in with development or comment in the Slack community they are a bunch of very friendly folks where much of the current development is focused If you\u2019re using Dokku especially for commercial purposes consider donating to project development via Github Sponsors OpenCollective or Patreon Funds go to

lists of ways to prevent cyberattacks but doesn t know how well they re being followed or who s in charge of putting them into practice according to a report from the Government Accountability Office The DoD has three initiatives underway on cyber hygiene or limiting cybersecurity risks but these efforts are incomplete or their status is unknown because no one is in charge of reporting on progress the GAO said The DoD also maintains lists of the types of cyberattacks most commonly used and methods to counter them but the department does not know the extent to which these practices have been implemented according to the report Related Military Spear Phishing Scams Surge as Pentagon Shifts to Telework In addition the DoD did not know the extent to which users of its networks have completed the mandatory Cyber Awareness training or whether those who have not completed the training have had their network access revoked The report notes that the DoD has become increasingly reliant on information technology systems and networks to manage logistics budgeting and military operations adding that the increasing reliance comes with increased risks The risks to IT systems supporting DOD are increasing as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve and become more sophisticated the GAO said China presents a growing attack threat to our core military systems and Russia is staging cyberattack assets to allow it to disrupt or damage U S military infrastructure according to intelligence reports cited in the report Compounding these threats IT systems are often riddled with cybersecurity vulnerabilities both known and unknown The GAO report was issued Monday afternoon hours after a Pentagon news conference at which DoD officials gave an upbeat account of efforts to prevent spear phishing or cyber cons aimed at getting usernames and passwords as the department manages a huge increase in telework during the novel coronavirus pandemic Dana Deasy DoD s chief information officer said one factor in keeping the workforce cyber secure in telework is the fact that we don t publish where we get the attack vectors from because that would just give insight to the adversary to know how to vector and pivot and change their tactics and techniques Deasy also signed off on the department s response to the GAO report which made seven recommendations to improve cybersecurity The DoD concurred with one recommendation partially concurred with four and did not concur with two It did not concur with the recommendation to have the deputy secretary of defense name a component in the DoD to oversee various tasks within the existing Cybersecurity Discipline Implementation Plan and report on progress in implementing them The DoD said the recommendation failed to take into account that the cyber landscape is constantly evolving to changes in technology threats and vulnerabilities The CDIP was approved in and it makes little sense to monitor compliance with

publicly stated that two Russian spacecraft were tailing a U S satellite He said that Russia\u2019s behavior was \u201chighly unusual and disturbing \u201d On April U S Space Command announced that Russia tested an anti satellite weapon Russia and China both recognize that American high precision warfighting is dependent on space systems According to the U S director of national intelligence both Russia and China are developing capabilities to destroy U S satellites in all orbital regimes \u2014 at all altitudes But unlike in the past the United States is not on its own It has allies and partners to turn to During the Cold War the United States and Soviet Union were the two dominant space powers and both worked diligently to develop space weapons European allies France in particular decried efforts to create anti satellite systems Since the collapse of the Soviet Union the number of spacefaring nations has markedly increased And as the world has become more dependent on space systems attitudes about space security have changed The United States has demonstrated its commitment to space security through the revival of U S Space Command and the establishment of the U S Space Force Other countries have too France and Japan for example have announced the creation of their own military space commands NATO has declared that space is an operational domain Now the United States has allies who are eager to create a more robust network for monitoring adversary activity on orbit and to establish a unified space doctrine to achieve a resilient space security framework Washington can build a coalition with its spacefaring allies to effectively prepare for and win a war that extends into outer space Indeed the United States should leverage its allies to build a more robust network to monitor and track activities in space While doing so Washington should lead its allies and the world to develop norms and practices that prevent destabilizing military activities in space The Cold War During the Cold War the United States included allies in its national security space activities but only on a limited basis America\u2019s focus was on reconnaissance satellites which were a closely held secret The U S government did not even acknowledge the existence of the National Reconnaissance Office until Space reconnaissance activities were not publicly discussed in any detail Cooperation in this sensitive area of U S space activity primarily involved the limited sharing of space derived intelligence with select allies Only the heads of NATO members were briefed on the existence of intelligence satellites Beyond those heads of states only the British had privileged access to American space capabilities The United States shared raw images from imagery satellites with the United Kingdom as far back as the 1960s The importance of space systems did not reduce allies\u2019 concerns about the weaponization of space even when the Soviet threat became more pronounced In the 1970s the Soviet Union possessed a co orbital anti satellite weapon \u2014 a satellite designed to maneuver next to its target on orbit and destroy it \u2014 called Istrebitel\u2019 sputnikov or \u201csatellite killer \u201d The United States promptly responded to the threat In then CIA director George H W Bush sent a memorandum to the national security advisor stating that the United States needed to re evaluate the vulnerability of its overhead reconnaissance systems Beginning in the United States reinvigorated its efforts to develop an operational anti satellite capability In the late 1960s the British had launched the Skynet series communication satellites that provided secure communications across the European theater the system is located in geosynchronous orbit \u2014 miles from Earth London was primarily concerned with discouraging the United States and Soviet Union from developing anti satellite weapons that could reach geosynchronous orbit The British worried that if the United States developed anti satellite weapons that could reach geosynchronous orbit the Soviet Union would follow suit and threaten Skynet The British did however support the United States in matching the existing Soviet anti satellite capability Most European allies were however overtly critical \u2014 or lukewarm at best \u2014 about America\u2019s efforts to develop an anti satellite weapon The French in particular were especially critical and called upon the United States and Soviet Union to prevent an arms race in space and implement arms control for anti satellite weapons Even as the allies began building their own space capabilities they were not supportive of U S efforts to respond militarily to the Soviet space threat Many NATO members were not fully aware of how dependent the alliance had become on information derived from space systems Washington had grown accustomed to pursuing national security activities in space under a shroud of secrecy with minimal allied consultation The Cold War legacy of U S dominance and secrecy has left many in the space community with the mistaken belief that the United States should again go it alone Ready Allies In the post Cold War era the space environment has markedly changed There has been a proliferation of both American and foreign commercial space capabilities an expansion of the number of spacefaring nations a greater reliance on space systems by not just the United States but also its allies and a significant growth in the number and sophistication of threat actors in space While the United States China and Russia are certainly the most capable spacefaring nations Washington\u2019s allies have much to offer to create greater resiliency for space systems and to win a war that extends into outer space As the threats expand U S cooperation with allies ought to expand as well Gen John Hyten the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has emphasized the necessity of expanding allied relationships in the space arena Unlike during the Cold War American allies are willing and eager to collaborate with the United States For example last year NATO declared space an operational domain However this announcement should be followed up with doctrine In the U K Ministry of Defense published a document entitled \u201cTowards a Defense Space Strategy \u201d The British government is intent on creating a cadre of space experts that can ensure the security of U K and allied national security space systems Britain\u2019s focus is on space related training and collaboration with capable spacefaring allies Moreover the United States already cooperates with Australia Canada New Zealand the United Kingdom France and Germany at U S Space Command\u2019s Combined Space Operations Center located at Vandenberg Air Force Base Additionally allies participate in the Schriever Wargames that examine \u201ccritical space and cyberspace issues in depth \u201d Today unlike during the Cold War U S allies are more aware of the threats to space systems The United Kingdom has made it very clear that it views space as a warfighting domain America\u2019s spacefaring allies therefore can serve as an important resource for ensuring continued U S space dominance Leveraging Allies Current allied involvement is a good start but more can be done to prepare for war extending into outer space \u2014 particularly in two areas space situational awareness now more commonly called space domain awareness and establishing space behavior norms In January of this year Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced his country\u2019s establishment of a Space Domain Mission Unit Additionally the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a stated goal of providing high quality space domain awareness and of \u201cmaintaining four information gathering satellite systems \u201d While the unit will be located at Fuchu Air Base and use a radar \u201ccapable of monitoring space systems up to an altitude of kilometers miles \u201d the Japanese Ministry of Defense \u201cwill share information collected by the facility with U S forces \u201d Japan is providing a replicable model for other spacefaring nations Allies can make a particularly valuable contribution to space security in the realm of space domain awareness As an increasingly diverse set of sensors are integrated with U S space domain awareness resources a more accurate picture of adversary activity in space can be achieved Fundamentally to obtain better space domain awareness terrestrial real estate matters More ground tracking stations allow the United States and its allies to better track threats on orbit By using radar and optical systems spread out all over the Earth it is possible to have much better coverage of potential threats in space The United States can also work with allies who do not have any space capabilities to install optical telescopes and radar systems that can create a more robust and global network for monitoring space threats Spacefaring allies even in the most nascent stage of development can play an invaluable role in this mission In early French President Emanuel Macron announced his country\u2019s establishment of a space command that will be placed under the French Air Force According to reports by the French Ministry of Defense the French space command will develop a modified version of its Syracuse satellites that can observe threats on orbit and use on board weapons to engage them if necessary Even if France decides not to arm its satellites in the near term its Syracuse system will have strong potential for expanding allied space domain awareness in space Though London has promised to present a formal U K space defense strategy one has not yet materialized During the Cold War Britain was the only European ally that provided political support for America\u2019s efforts to develop space weapons Up until very recently however Britain has been largely silent on space security issues Last year then Defence Minister Gavin Williamson said the United Kingdom would remain at the forefront of the space domain London is investing more in space intelligence capabilities but it is not keeping pace with the threats from more sophisticated states Smaller allied countries might have limited but highly specialized services to offer a space coalition Estonia for example has a reputation for high tech innovation especially in cyber security and digital services Estonia has established its Space Office which is working with universities and start ups to develop a broad spectrum of satellites especially micro satellites U S investment in countries like Estonia can help create space innovation eco systems that can contribute to the overall resiliency of allied military space activity The integration of allied and international commercial space domain awareness and satellite systems is a necessary task but there are substantial obstacles to overcome in the process A RAND report stated that \u201cU S European military space activities suffer a plight equal if not worse than the slate of more traditional interoperability issues that arise among NATO allies \u201d As more countries contribute to space domain awareness uniformity of data types will be of even greater importance Many allied space programs are in a nascent stage and their potential has not been fully realized Washington should actively encourage and work with European partners in their efforts to develop more capable space systems As European allies develop more sophisticated capabilities for monitoring the space environment Washington should push for interoperable systems that enable the seamless sharing of data across NATO The United States should work with European partners to develop a framework for monitoring and reacting to adversary threat activity such as a joint architecture for processing data from the many different allied space domain awareness sensors A unified doctrine would focus on measures that enable foreign government and commercial systems to augment any loss of U S capability due to an attack There are however potential legal obstacles and data compatibility issues that will likely prevent the realization of an effective unified doctrine in the near term Most importantly Washington should work with its spacefaring allies to develop comprehensive plans for reacting to an attack on an allied space asset However a military response does not have to include an attack on an adversary space system The fundamental need is having the ability to respond quickly and in a unified manner to any space attack An integrated diplomatic response should be created for space crises as well Establishing Norms in Space During the Cold War the United States refused to establish public policies regarding threats to space systems The State Department and Intelligence Community consistently advised the White House not to even publicly provide a definition of outer space Refraining from establishing specific and clearly articulated policies is no longer an option in the post Cold War era Allies \u2014 and potential allies \u2014 can assist the United States in establishing norms in space If Paris moves ahead with deploying on orbit weapons the United States and all other NATO members should work with France to develop specific rules of engagement for the use of space weapons Fundamentally France is making it clear that Washington has a potential partner in a space war that is willing to use offensive weapons It is essential however to ensure that there is an agreed upon framework for using French offensive capabilities to respond to an attack against an allied system Additionally Washington should strongly urge Paris not to test any weapon systems against objects in space Such testing could create debris that is a threat to other satellites and could encourage Russia and China to follow up with similar tests Because of greater access to space technology the number of spacefaring nations will continue to grow while there will be an increase in the number of state actors that possess space weapons The Indian anti satellite weapon demonstration is a case in point Iran for another example could construct a crude anti satellite weapon in the near term Therefore it is imperative for the United States to work with Israel \u2014 the most capable spacefaring nation in the Middle East \u2014 in monitoring and deterring Tehran from entering the space weapons arena Russia\u2019s recent anti satellite weapon test and tailing of a U S satellite and previous U S State Department statements about Moscow\u2019s destabilizing behavior highlight the lack of established norms for military space operations For example how close is too close for a satellite Clearly establishing a code of conduct in space is something that the United States cannot do on its own It should be a joint effort with spacefaring allies around the globe Additionally it is imperative that America and its allies publicly confront Russia in particular about its dangerous behavior in space Russia China and the United States are especially concerned about rendezvous and proximity operations such as maneuvering close to another space object If a country conducts rendezvous and proximity operations without providing any warning or explanation the action could be treated as a hostile military act Just as an uncoordinated approach by a foreign vessel to a U S Navy ship would be treated as an aggressive act so too should similar maneuvers that involve American and allied spacecraft Therefore it is vital for Washington to work with its allies to establish what specific space behaviors will be considered unacceptable and to communicate \u2014 and enforce \u2014 such standards with aggressive spacefaring nations like Russia and China The United States and its allies should work collectively to prevent the testing of weapons in space The debris generated from these tests poses a threat to the satellites of all spacefaring nations If more nations begin testing anti satellite weapons military space systems could be inadvertently damaged This situation could lead to an overall escalation in preexisting tension The United States and its allies providing a clearly defined code of conduct for national security space activities is a feasible and necessary step to take in the immediate term Stronger Together Certainly though no one wants a war to begin in or extend into outer space ignoring this possibility would be extremely negligent The United States possesses highly sophisticated national security space systems that will be a prime target for capable spacefaring adversaries if a conflict should arise In the past the United States has presumed it can and will fight alone in space \u2014 but that is no longer necessary Washington can better ensure its dominance in space if it more fully embraces its allies Washington would be wise to build a coalition that creates a more robust system for monitoring the space domain reacting to space threats and prevailing in a war that extends into outer space Building a space coalition \u2014 especially one that includes allies from Europe the Middle East and Asia \u2014 is no simple task But working towards systems integration and also a common space doctrine is positive step forward towards increased resiliency of the space systems that are essential for precision warfighting Of course technical systems cannot be the only focus of the coalition it should also devote attention to the development of norms for military space activity Hyten has stated that \u201ctrying to fight alone in space would be a mistake\u201d \u2014 a mistake that we cannot afford to make Aaron Bateman is pursuing a Ph D in the history of science and technology at Johns Hopkins University Previously

bids have been funded as part of the Countering Drones competition launched earlier this year by the then Defence Secretary Among the proposal being developed are methods for detecting 4G and 5G controlled drones cutting edge applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence for sensors to automatically identify UAVs and low risk methods of stopping drones through novel electronic defeat or interceptor solutions The competition run by DASA the MOD\u2019s innovation hub on behalf of Defence Science and Technology Laboratory Dstl is the latest stage in Dstl \u2019s ongoing research programme into countering unmanned air systems UAS which has been running for ten years The competition has also been supported by the Department for Transport and NATO to counter the rapidly evolving threats from UAS David Lugton competition technical lead said The introduction of Unmanned Air Systems UAS often referred to as drones has been one of the most significant technological advances of recent years and represents a shift in capability of potential adversaries The threat from UAS has evolved rapidly and we are seeing the use of hostile improvised UAS threats in overseas theatres of operation There is a similar problem in the UK with the malicious or accidental use of drones becoming a security challenge at events affecting critical infrastructure and public establishments including prisons and major UK airports There was a very high level of interest from industry with over bids from a wide range of organisations from micro businesses small and medium sized enterprises large defence firms and academia This led to a doubling of initial funding from around \u00a3 million to around \u00a3 million being awarded to organisations in Phase The first phase of this competition is intended to demonstrate proof of concepts that can be further developed and integrated during later phases Phase is planned to launch next year with a focus on developing and maturing successful research into integrated solutions The projects funded around \u00a3 each are Airspeed Electronics Ltd to develop an artificial intelligence detection system which uses acoustic sensors Animal Dynamics to develop UAS swarm system to detect and neutralise Unmanned Air Vehicles UAV by employing peregrine falcon attack strategies Autonomous Devices Limited to develop

form and function for Marines The Plate Carrier Generation III is a lightweight plate carrying system that guards against bullets and fragmentation when coupled with protective plates \u201cThis system protects Marines on the battlefield \u201d said Lt Col Andrew Konicki the Program Manager for Infantry Combat Equipment at Marine Corps Systems Command \u201cThe PC Gen III is important because it is nearly percent lighter than the legacy technology \u201d The Marine Corps constantly looks for ways to lighten the load for Marines PM ICE worked with industry to remove excess bulk from the legacy Plate Carrier which was fielded in The elimination of excess material reduces the overall weight of the system and increases maneuverability said Konicki \u201cWhen you lighten the load Marines can get to their destinations faster and they\u2019re going to have more endurance which increases their lethality \u201d said Konicki In MCSC conducted a study to analyze the components and effectiveness of a prototype version of the PC Gen III Marines tested both the legacy and prototype systems during various obstacle courses including a kilometer hike at a fixed pace The results of the study showed that participants completed the courses faster and appeared better conditioned when using the newer technology Marines\u2019 mobility and ability to handle a weapon improved when using the PC Gen III prototype said Konicki \u201cThe PC Gen III improves the Marines\u2019 ability to shoot and move by eliminating excess bulk from the design and cutting out the shoulders for a better rifle stock weld \u201d added Lt Col Bryan Leahy Individual Armor Team lead in PM ICE Fits men and women Another advantage of the PC Gen III lies in its fit MCSC increased the variation of sizes enabling nearly more Marines\u2014both male and female\u2014to fit into the system when compared with the legacy technology said Konicki The newer system fits closer to the body increasing protection and decreasing the risk of injury due to improper fit The next generation system is designed to fit individuals of all sizes and statures\u2014from the 2nd percentile female Marine to the 98th percentile male Marine A curvature in the associated protective plates accommodates chest and abdomen size without compromising protection \u201cI think there\u2019s a misconception that all females are small and that\u2019s not always true\u201d said Konicki \u201cWe conducted a study that found the smallest Marine is actually male \u201d According to Konicki during multiple user evaluations female Marines have said they prefer the newer technology to the legacy system because of its fit and mobility Infantry and infantry like Marines will be the first to receive the PC Gen III The new vest body armor will then be fielded to supporting units The program office expects the PC Gen III to reach Full Operational Capability by fiscal year By Matt Gonzales MCSC Office of

off the production line and began flying for the 52nd Fighter Wing The aircraft Tail No is the first Block Fighting Falcon in Europe and only the second F in the U S Air Force s inventory to reach the historic milestone something maintainers hailed as a testament to its durability and their dedicated labor An F at Misawa Air Base in northern Japan hit the mark a year ago but that jet was delivered a year earlier than Spangdahlem s maintainers said It also took years and months to reach hours two months longer than No It takes a lot of work and a lot of diligence and a lot of very thorough inspections to keep the aircraft safe and ready to fly said Senior Master Sgt Andrew Yates of the 480th Aircraft Maintenance Unit at Spangdahlem The plane s been flying since before about of the people in this building were even born definitely before any of us even joined the military he said Both are true for 1st Lt Christina Nunley the assistant officer in charge for the 480th AMU This aircraft has been at Spangdahlem longer than I have been alive she said Obviously there are struggles that come with having an older aircraft but the history behind it is a huge motivating factor and it s something that we take a lot of pride in Chief Master Sgt Chris Yager is part of that history His first assignment out of tech school in was at Spangdahlem where he worked on the jet and saw it reach flight hours Back then there were those old crusty guys that were out there training me how to work on aircraft and sometimes I wondered why they were training me the way they were said Yager the 52nd Maintenance Group superintendent With Thursday s milestone Yager said he sees the fruits of that labor Keeping No airworthy involved about hours of work by ground crews maintainers said The F on average requires hours of maintenance for every hour of flying time a figure that includes thorough inspections refueling and basic maintenance such as changing tires and oil The wing s vice commander Col Jason Hokaj took the jet up Thursday afternoon for less than an hour to reached the milestone Base firefighters hosed down the aircraft as it taxied down the flightline after landing This is such an amazing event to be part of Hokaj said in a statement To think about the amount of hands and minds used to get here to keep this machine flying it s a testament to the professionalism of the 52nd Maintenance Group The Lockheed Martin Block F 16s that the 480th Fighter Squadron flies were initially designed to last flight hours Yates said But a series of upgrades has kept many of them going past that mark he said Yager likened the F to the Air Force s Cold War era B bomber which is still in service after more than years It was only designed for so many hours but it keeps going and going he said Lockheed Martin s F 35A Lightning II is the planned replacement for the F across the service but due to delays in the program the F 16s are expected to receive service life extension upgrades to keep them airworthy until and beyond No was part of the 480th s deployment for Operation Inherent Resolve to Iraq and Syria in when the squadron broke a record for number of munitions dropped by an F unit within a six month period It s just been a good durable aircraft Yates said There s a lot of superstition in the maintenance community rubbing the bellies and certain things but

Air Force 1st Lt Derek May medical plans and operations officer for Region I Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Task Force Twelve medical teams are activated throughout the state underneath Task Force CBRN Medical Support Element and have been assisting medical facilities and nursing homes with high risk populations The residents at these facilities are unable to do drive through testing or go to local urgent care centers Bringing this capability directly to the residents helps facilities identify positive COVID patients which allows them to then apply increased safety procedures to help slow and stop the spread of the coronavirus May said When the patients see military personnel it gives them comfort said Air Force Tech Sgt Joseph Startup 102nd Medical Group clinical supervisor They know we are out here to keep our community and our citizens safe during this time Nursing homes and providers are identified by the Department of Public Health and Human Services for testing each morning and given to the medical teams Each team typically visits three or four locations a day resulting in an average of more than total tests per day The swabs are packaged in a cooler and delivered to DPH at the end of each day Startup said Testing teams have six to nine guard members composed of medics CBRN decontamination personnel and a noncommissioned officer in charge who oversees the team Airmen and soldiers are spread throughout each team and are conducting missions jointly Integrating with our sister service partners in the Army has been seamless May said From Day One all of the soldiers and airmen have banded together to provide the same level of service to the commonwealth s citizens Some of the soldiers supporting this mission are from infantry and artillery units They received extensive training on how to wear the required protective equipment and properly conduct a swab test All testing team members are monitored by a medical team leader who ensures the tests are done accurately and that everyone is staying safe It s really a huge successful display of teamwork said Army Maj Ryan Lee a dental officer providing medical supervision and quality control It\u2019s an incredible sight to see infantry and field artillery soldiers who are trained to administer COVID tests step outside of their military occupational specialty to answer the call After the testing is completed inside each facility everyone on the team goes through a detailed decontamination process which includes safely removing the personal protective equipment and being sprayed with chemicals to

Zoom removed the feature but its response should worry you about its sloppy coding practices in general \u201cWe originally implemented the \u2018Login with Facebook\u2019 feature using the Facebook SDK in order to provide our users with another convenient way to access our platform However we were recently made aware that the Facebook SDK was collecting unnecessary device data \u201d Zoom told Motherboard in a statement on Friday This isn\u2019t the first time Zoom was sloppy with security Last year a researcher discovered that a vulnerability in the Mac Zoom client allowed any malicious website to enable the camera without permission This seemed like a deliberate design choice that Zoom designed its service to bypass browser security settings and remotely enable a user\u2019s web camera without the user\u2019s knowledge or consent EPIC filed an FTC complaint over this Zoom patched this vulnerability last year On we learned that Zoom for Windows can be used to steal users\u2019 Window credentials Attacks work by using the Zoom chat window to send targets a string of text that represents the network location on the Windows device they\u2019re using The Zoom app for Windows automatically converts these so called universal naming convention strings \u2014 such as \\attacker example com C \u2014 into clickable links In the event that targets click on those links on networks that aren\u2019t fully locked down Zoom will send the Windows usernames and the corresponding NTLM hashes to the address contained in the link On we learned that Zoom secretly displayed data from people\u2019s LinkedIn profiles which allowed some meeting participants to snoop on each other Zoom has fixed this one I\u2019m sure lots more of these bad security decisions sloppy coding mistakes and random software vulnerabilities are coming But it gets worse Zoom\u2019s encryption is awful First the company claims that it offers end to end encryption but it doesn\u2019t It only provides link encryption which means everything is unencrypted on the company\u2019s servers From the Intercept In Zoom\u2019s white paper there is a list of \u201cpre meeting security capabilities\u201d that are available to the meeting host that starts with \u201cEnable an end to end E2E encrypted meeting \u201d Later in the white paper it lists \u201cSecure a meeting with E2E encryption\u201d as an \u201cin meeting security capability\u201d that\u2019s available to meeting hosts When a host starts a meeting with the \u201cRequire Encryption for 3rd Party Endpoints\u201d setting enabled participants see a green padlock that says \u201cZoom is using an end to end encrypted connection\u201d when they mouse over it But when reached for comment about whether video meetings are actually end to end encrypted a Zoom spokesperson wrote \u201cCurrently it is not possible to enable E2E encryption for Zoom video meetings Zoom video meetings use a combination of TCP and UDP TCP connections are made using TLS and UDP connections are encrypted with AES using a key negotiated over a TLS connection \u201d They\u2019re also lying about the type of encryption On Citizen Lab reported Zoom documentation claims that the app uses \u201cAES \u201d encryption for meetings where possible However we find that in each Zoom meeting a single AES key is used in ECB mode by all participants to encrypt and decrypt audio and video The use of ECB mode is not recommended because patterns present in the plaintext are preserved during encryption The AES keys which we verified are sufficient to decrypt Zoom packets intercepted in Internet traffic appear to be generated by Zoom servers and in some cases are delivered to participants in a Zoom meeting through servers in China even when all meeting participants and the Zoom subscriber\u2019s company are outside of China I\u2019m okay with AES but using ECB electronic codebook mode indicates that there is no one at the company who knows anything about cryptography And that China connection is worrisome Citizen Lab again Zoom a Silicon Valley based company appears to own three companies in China through which at least employees are paid to develop Zoom\u2019s software This arrangement is ostensibly an effort at labor arbitrage Zoom can avoid paying US wages while selling to US customers thus increasing their profit margin However this arrangement may make Zoom responsive to pressure from Chinese authorities Or from Chinese programmers slipping backdoors into the code at the request of the government Finally bad user configuration Zoom has a lot of options The defaults aren\u2019t great and if you don\u2019t configure your meetings right you\u2019re leaving yourself open to all sort of mischief \u201c Zoombombing \u201d is the most visible problem People are finding open Zoom meetings classes and events joining them and sharing their screens to broadcast offensive content \u2014 porn mostly \u2014 to everyone It\u2019s awful if you\u2019re the victim and a consequence of allowing any participant to share their screen Even without screen sharing people are logging in to random Zoom meetings and disrupting them Turns out that Zoom didn\u2019t make the meeting ID long enough to prevent someone from randomly trying them looking for meetings This isn\u2019t new Checkpoint Research reported this last summer Instead of making the meeting IDs longer or more complicated \u2014 which it should have done \u2014 it enabled meeting passwords by default Of course most of us don\u2019t use passwords and there are now automatic tools for finding Zoom meetings For help securing your Zoom sessions Zoom has a good guide Short summary don\u2019t share the meeting ID more than you have to use a password in addition to a meeting ID use the waiting room if you can and pay attention to who has what permissions That\u2019s what we know about Zoom\u2019s privacy and security so far Expect more revelations in the weeks and months to come The New York Attorney General is investigating the company Security researchers are combing through the software looking for other things Zoom is doing and not telling anyone about There are more stories waiting to be discovered Zoom is a security and privacy disaster but until now had managed to avoid public accountability because it was relatively obscure Now that it\u2019s in the spotlight it\u2019s all coming out Their response to all of this is here On the company said it would freeze all feature development and focus on security and privacy Let\u2019s see if that\u2019s anything more than a PR move In the meantime you should either lock Zoom down as best you can or \u2014 better yet \u2014 abandon the platform altogether Jitsi is a distributed free and open source alternative Start your meeting here EDITED TO ADD Fight for the Future is on this Steve Bellovin\u2019s comments Meanwhile lots of Zoom video recordings are available on the Internet The article doesn\u2019t have any useful details about how they got there Videos viewed by The Post included one on one therapy sessions a training orientation for workers doing telehealth calls which included people\u2019s names and phone numbers small business meetings which included private company financial statements and elementary school classes in which children\u2019s faces voices and personal details were exposed Many of the videos include personally identifiable information and deeply intimate conversations recorded in people\u2019s homes Other videos include nudity such as one in which an aesthetician teaches students how to give a Brazilian wax \u2026 Many of the videos can be found on unprotected chunks of Amazon storage space known as buckets which are widely used across the Web Amazon buckets are locked down by default but many users make the storage space publicly accessible either inadvertently or to share files with other people EDITED TO ADD

nonnuclear Command Control and Communications C3 operations as well For this reason E 6s have at times been deployed to Europe and the Middle East to serve as flying C3 hubs In a military that operates Raptor stealth fighters A tank busters B bombers and Harrier jump jets the U S Navy\u2019s placid looking E Mercury based on the airliner seems particularly inoffensive But don\u2019t be deceived by appearances Though the Mercury doesn\u2019t carry any weapons of its own it may be in a sense the deadliest aircraft operated by the Pentagon as its job is to command the launch of land based and sea based nuclear ballistic missiles Of course the U S military has a ground based strategic Global Operations Center in Nebraska and land based transmitters for communicating with the nuclear triad However the E \u2019s sinister purpose is to maintain the communication link between the national command authority starting with the president and secretary of defense and U S nuclear forces even if ground based command centers are destroyed by an enemy first strike In other words you can chop off the head of the U S nuclear forces but the body will keep on coming at you thanks to these doomsday planes The E \u2019s basic mission is known as Take Charge and Move Out TACAMO Prior to the development of the E the TACAMO mission was undertaken by land based transmitter and later EC 130G and Q Hercules aircraft which had Very Low Frequency radios for communication with navy submarines Interestingly France also operated its own TACAMO aircraft until four modified Transall C 160H Astart\u00e9 transports which maintained VLF communications with French ballistic missile submarines The first of sixteen E 6s entered service between and These were the last built in a very long line of military variants of the venerable Boeing airliner in particular the 320B Advanced also used in the E Sentry Bristling with thirty one communication antennas the E 6As were originally tasked solely with communicating with submerged Navy submarines Retrofitted with more fuel efficient CFM turbojets and benefiting from expanded fuel tanks the E 6A could remain in the air up to fifteen hours or seventy two with inflight refueling To use its Very Low Frequency radios an E has to fly in a continuous orbit at a high altitude with its fuselage and tail mounted VLF radios trailing one and five mile long wire antennas at a near vertical attitude The VLF signals can be received by Ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarines hiding deep underwater thousands of miles away However the VLF transmitters\u2019 limited bandwidth means they can only send raw data at around thirty five alphanumeric characters per second\u2014making them a lot slower than even the old 14k internet modems of the 1990s Still it\u2019s enough to transmit Emergency Action Messages instructing the ballistic missile subs to execute one of a diverse menu of preplanned nuclear attacks ranging from limited to full scale nuclear strikes The E \u2019s systems are also hardened to survive the electromagnetic pulse from nuclear weapons detonating below Between and the Pentagon upgraded the entire E 6A fleet to the dual role E 6B which expanded the Mercury\u2019s capabilities by allowing it to serve as an Airborne Nuclear Command Post with its own battle staff area for the job In this role it serves as a backup for four huge E command post aircraft based on the Jumbo jet The E 6B has ultra high frequency radios in its Airborne Launch Control system that enable it to remotely launch land based ballistic missiles from their underground silos a task formerly assigned to U S Air Force EC Looking Glass aircraft\u2014yet another variant The E \u2019s crew was expanded from fourteen to twenty two for the command post mission usually including an onboard admiral or general Additional UHF radios give the E 6B access to the survivable MILSTAR satellite communications network while the cockpit is upgraded up with new avionics and instruments from the 737NG airliner The E 6B can be distinguished in photos by its additional wing mounted pods The Mercury\u2019s abundant communications gear allows it to perform nonnuclear Command Control and Communications C3 operations as well For this reason E 6s have at times been deployed to Europe and the Middle East to serve as flying C3 hubs For example VQ was deployed in Qatar for three years from to where it relayed information such as IED blast reports and medical evacuation requests from U S troops in Iraq who were out of contact with their headquarters Two Navy Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadrons currently operate the E VQ \u201cIronmen\u201d and VQ \u201cShadows \u201d both under the Navy Strategic Communications Wing These have their home at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma but also routinely forward deploy out of Travis AFB in California and Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland At least one E is kept airborne at all times E 6s on the submarine communication mission often fly in circles over the ocean at the lowest possible speed\u2014for as long as ten hours at a time Those performing the nuclear command post mission typically remain on alert near Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska The E \u2019s nuclear mission has also made its operations occasional fodder for conspiracy theorists and foreign propaganda outlets The E platform should remain in service until thanks to a service life extension program and continual tweaks to its systems and radios While the Mercury has demonstrated its usefulness as an airborne communication hub for supporting troops in the field the airborne command post will be considered a success if it never has to execute its primary mission The heart of nuclear deterrence after all is convincing potential adversaries that no first strike will be adequate to prevent a devastating riposte The E 6s are vital component in making that threat a credible one S\u00e9bastien

gas companies over a week starting on March attached two files that masqueraded as bidding conditions forms and a request for proposal The relatively small number of emails demonstrates a narrow

Bitdefender \u201cTo someone in the oil gas industry who has knowledge about these projects the email and the information within might seem sufficiently convincing to open the attachments \u201d researchers from security firm Bitdefender wrote in a post published on Tuesday The most targeted companies were located in Malaysia the United States Iran South Africa and Oman Bitdefender A second campaign started on April It sent an email asking recipients to complete a document known as an Estimated Port Disbursement Account needed for the chemical and oil tanker named MT Sinar Maluku Not

target a vertical Pandemic induced glut The campaigns are likely an attempt to gain closely guarded information about the current negotiations between Russia Saudi Arabia and other oil producers struggling with a glut of crude resulting from the coronavirus pandemic Bitdefender said this is hardly the first time companies in this industry have been targeted The security firm has been tracking

the UK Ukraine and Latvia Enlarge The geographical distribution \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that until now it has not been associated with campaigns targeting the oil gas vertical \u201d Bitdefender researchers added The campaign provides a reminder that despite the growing awareness of phishing attacks they remain one of the most effective ways for attackers to gain a foothold in targeted companies Even when phishing emails contain misspellings grammatical mistakes and other flaws recipients often rightly assume those are the results of senders writing in a second language

a lot of our work is about social interaction Especially in smaller libraries we\u2019re sometimes the only ones people see in a week \u201d says Carol Stump chief librarian at Kirklees council in West Yorkshire \u201cWe wanted to be sure that with libraries in lockdown people could still access our services And we felt they might be glad of a chat \u201d Stump runs a team of library staff Many of them have been redeployed during the pandemic but those still working for the library service are keeping in touch with local people particularly those over Calls help people feel less isolated and library staff can check whether they have enough food and medical supplies or need other support One year old man for example was missing his regular trip to the library to read the local paper but is now able to read it online \u201cIt\u2019s gone down so well People have been so grateful \u201d says Stump The sudden switch from a physical space to online has been challenging for staff and users but has also highlighted the vital role of library services and the skills of staff From Orkney\u2019s Lego challenge to Truro\u2019s storytime at home sessions librarians are coming up with innovative ways to stay engaged with users and each other While many library staff have been redeployed to emergency roles with their councils such as working on telephone helplines packing and distributing care packages and working as registrars those still in their core roles are seeing demand leap for all kinds of digital services Online borrowing has soared since March when the UK went

their Big Spring Read In while Manchester libraries are running a creative challenge for young people In Suffolk a new online advice service has been launched \u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget what we do as public librarians which is provide information you can trust \u201d explains Krystal Vittles head of Suffolk library service delivery \u201cSome question why we need librarians for this when we have the internet but even the most internet savvy people are worried about what to trust and we are trained for this \u201d It also enables staff to have a conversation albeit online with people as they would in real life \u201cWe can have a bit of a laugh with the customers \u201d Librarians are using social media to share lighter moments with one another too such as a Twitter conversation about interesting bookmarks they\u2019ve found in library books including an After Eight mint still in its wrapper and a Blockbuster card \u201ca proper ancient artefact\u201d Staff and readers are also creating huge amounts of online content with one rhyme time by a library regular shielding at home reaching more than views Librarian Ian Anstice editor of Public Libraries News has written that the pandemic has highlighted the ingenuity and ability of library staff \u201cCovid has been to library services the equivalent of what the second world war was to arms manufacturing \u201d he writes \u201cSuddenly within a week in lots of cases librarians have switched to online services How good that makes library services look to their councils \u201d Being able to prove the value of services to their communities and being appreciated by local politicians is welcome news for many libraries after years of cuts \u2013 in the year to March British libraries closed with more closures the following year There has also been investment during the crisis Arts Council England has announced a \u00a3 grant for each of the public library services in England to help them purchase new digital stock Libraries are finding innovative ways to use resources including using 3D printers and laser cutters to produce PPE equipment In Gateshead where libraries recently became part of the

air defence designer of the Shipunov KBP design bureau a Tula based subsidiary of Rostec\u2019s High Precision Weapons Holding Mr Slugin a KBP veteran has been working on the PANTSIR system a multi meaning Russian word which could be translated as \u2018armour cuirass or shell\u2019 for over years during which time the system has gained the NATO nickname SA GREYHOUND The system PANTSIR S is a ground based self propelled surface to air missile gun system to safeguard a variety of objects including long range air defence systems military HQs and important civilian objects from all types of air based threats ranging from MLRS rockets and mortar shells up to cruise missiles tactical ballistic and hypersonic weapons in addition to various types of drone PANTSIR is armed with Surface to Air missiles SAMs in two containers positioned on both sides of the system turret which also employs two 30mm guns with a firing ratio up to rounds per second The initial version has been dramatically modernised and is in service with the Russian Army as its main mobile and stationary close range air defence complex while the ODINTSOVO class missile corvette became the first Russian Navy combatant armed with PANTSIR M the navalised version and it is planned to be installed aboard newly built and upgraded ships The export version called as PANTSIR SE was sold to a number of Russia\u2019s friendly nations including Iraq Syria Algeria and Ethiopia with Serbia becoming the latest customer earlier this year According to Rosoboronexport CEO Aleksander Mikheev PANTSIR has become one of the national best sellers on the world defence market Talking about PANTSIR\u2019s performance Slugin confirmed that it has shot down about drones in various locations throughout its service \u201cAbout maybe more \u201d he said to the TASS correspondent \u201cthat includes Syria and other regions \u201d Operational Service The latest attack disclosed by the Russian Foreign Ministry took place on 6th February this year when an unidentified small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle UAV was stopped by an airbase\u2019s radar when it approached the Russian installation from the northeastern part of the Mediterranean Sea after dark \u201cThe target was destroyed by the PANTSIR S missiles at a distance from the airbase No one was hurt No material damage was done \u201d the ministry official said adding that the airbase is operating routinely The previous UAV attack on the Hmeimim base were staged by militants on 19th January when the air targets were downed at a safe distance from the base according to the Russian Ministry of Defence spokesman Mr Slugin also confirmed two PANTSIR divisions were deployed to Syria a Russian one to protect military assets at Hmeimim and Tartus in addition to one operated by Syria Describing the terrorist\u2019s tactics Slugin said that they used to tie up to bombs to each UAV which made them perfectly visible on the radar screen but later the militants cut the number to just two so the UAV\u2019s signature was dramatically reduced To cope with a new threat \u201cwe had to apply some effort to teach the systems how to take down such targets \u201d stated the designer After certain improvements to both the station and missiles the system became capable of fighting mini UAVs such as the Phantom quadcopter which has a maximum size about a foot in diameter \u201cThe fight against small low speed targets is a real challenge for all radar stations and today other air defence systems are incapable of fighting such drones \u201d explained Slugin \u201cWe have adapted the radar for detecting and precisely tracking low observable targets \u201d he said adding that \u201ccertain improvements were made in the missile as well\u201d Diverse targets Talking further about the experience in Syria Mr Slugin claimed the system\u2019s guns had been used to destroy civilian vehicles being used as suicide bombs \u201cThe PANTSIR can defend itself against an infantry fighting vehicle or a \u201cjihad mobile\u201d and this is how its guns were used in Syria and this use proved to be effective \u201d he said However the missiles remain PANTSIR\u2019s main weapon \u201cWe try not to allow a target to approach the gunfire range The closest range for the missile is about km Only if something comes closer do we destroy these targets with the guns \u201d he explained He also added that PANTSIR would be capable of hitting naval surface targets \u201cI believe that PANTSIR will be able to attack surface targets on the sea too If placed on the coast preferably as high as possible the system will be able to attack surface ships ten kilometers away\u201d Slugin also commented on a video from 10th May later circulated on Twitter which showed Syrian PANTSIR S vehicles being destroyed by an Israeli guided missile presumably a SPIKE model He said that ahead of being hit the PANTSIR S had destroyed eight targets expending its ammunition stock so the combat crew had left the vehicle and were waiting for the arrival of a Transport and Loader Vehicle TLV to replenish stores which turned out to be the fatal mistake \u201cThe combat vehicle should have been removed from the firing position as soon as the set of ammunition had been spent If that had happened everything would\u2019ve been fine \u201d Slugin claimed as he gave some new details about which missiles are compatible with the system \u201cThere are two missiles that fight the entire range of targets One is standard while the other has been developed recently and is hypersonic it can reach a speed of Mach and more \u201d he said giving the system an unprecedented advantage Speaking about the PANTSIR\u2019s future development he mentioned that a new small size missile for attacking mini UAVs could be created in three to four years from now as the Research and Development work is currently on the way Evolution According to the PANTSIR\u2019s chief designer the main task now is to increase the set of ammunition to be used against small targets and simultaneously reduce costs At the moment one PANTSIR vehicle employs a standard set of ammunition consisting of missiles and artillery shells capable of destroying about targets or more but in a modern combat situation this may not be enough \u201cWe can supply the PANTSIR vehicle with four times more small missiles This will increase combat effectiveness and the number of targets that can be destroyed \u201d he went on \u201dCurrently we destroy small targets \u2026 at a distance of kilometres Why should we stuff the missile with so much explosives and equip it with extremely powerful engines It is economically feasible to make a small missile \u201d concluded Mr Slugin The designer believes that small missiles will be as long as the standard ones but smaller in diameter so instead of one standard missile the launcher will be equipped with a cluster of four \u201cHalf of the payload may be comprised of the small sized missiles allowing us to load missiles just on one side of the vehicle \u201d he noted The small missiles installation won\u2019t require major alteration \u201conly the launcher\u2019s electronic brain will have to be changed \u201d Mr Slugin pointed out Another improvement to the PANTSIR system comes with the future TLV capability for firing missiles while receiving data on targets from the system\u2019s main radar unit \u201cWe plan to develop a new support vehicle that will carry an even bigger payload \u201d Slugin said adding that the new \u201cTLV may become a transporting combat vehicle \u201d According to the designer the TLV will receive target designation from the main unit but will fire missiles on its own and carry twice as many missiles as the main unit compared to PANTSIR\u2019s Keeping in mind the PANTSIR\u2019s excellent performance today as well as its post upgrade capabilities the system can remain Russia\u2019s bestseller for at least another decade as according to the recent statement by Dmitry Shugaev of the Russian Federal Service on military technical cooperation \u201c countries from the

innovative approaches being developed include imaging in difficult environments such as through clouds or smoke low or no light and through foliage or camouflage detecting and identifying small targets such as drones snipers people weapons and vehicles identifying objects more than kilometres away and classify friendly or adversary vehicles Additionally EOIR sensors offer a complementary approach to radio frequency sensors being able to detect objects in environments where radar is challenged or to operate against objects that have a naturally lower radar signature so are harder to identify Andy Cole Dstl project manager said The ever evolving nature of military operations means that we wish to invest in novel and resilient technologies that can function in contested and congested environments that will extend the range lower the cost and size and expand the range of targets that can be addressed by EOIR sensors DASA associate delivery manager Katy Violet said DASA

whether they can improve a shooter s probability of hitting targets faster than current Army issue optics Currently the service uses the M68 Close Combat Optic CCO and the M150 rifle Combat Optic RCO The CCO is an unmagnified red dot sight designed for ranges out to meters The RCO has a 4X magnification for engagements out to meters One of the Army s modernization priorities is to develop a Next Generation Squad Weapon that will replace the M4A1 and M249 squad automatic weapon in infantry and other close combat units Both weapons will be equipped with a fire control system that will calculate range to target and compensate with environmental conditions such as wind that can affect accuracy service officials say Related Army Wants to Replace Rifle Combat Optic with New Variable Power Sight The Army also announced in August that it s evaluating optics from seven vendors competing for the Direct View Optic DVO effort a variable power optic that will feature magnification settings from 1X to 6X compared to the 4X on the RCO Army officials at the Maneuver Battle Lab hope that commercial fire control systems being evaluated during the AEWE will help guide a future requirement for an

Executing a full rewrite of the Dropbox sync engine was pretty daunting Read more about our goals and how we made the decision in our previous post here Doing so meant taking the engine that powers Dropbox on hundreds of millions of user\u2019s machines and swapping it out mid flight To pull this off we knew we would need a serious investment in automated testing Our testing strategy gave us confidence that we were on the right track throughout the rewrite and today it allows us to continue building and shipping new features on a quick release cycle First we\u2019ll discuss the types of testability considerations that went into the design of Nucleus our new sync engine and then we\u2019ll get into some of the randomized testing systems that we built on top of our test friendly architecture When we embarked on the rewrite one thing was clear to have a robust testing strategy the new system would have to be testable Emphasizing testability early even before implementing the associated testing frameworks was critical to ensuring that our architecture was informed appropriately But what does testability even mean We can look to Sync Engine Classic the legacy system for insights Why wasn\u2019t the old system testable What made it so hard to avoid regressions and maintain correctness in that system And what did we learn that informed the architecture of our new system Protocol and data model For one the server client protocol and data model of Sync Engine Classic were designed for a simpler time and a simpler product before Dropbox had sharing before Dropbox had comments and annotations and before Dropbox was used by thousand person enterprise teams Dropbox has evolved quite a bit in the years since we designed the original system and the requirements have changed greatly Sync Engine Classic\u2019s client server protocol often resulted in a set of possible sync states far too permissive for us to be able to test effectively For example a client could receive metadata from the server about a file at baz cat before receiving its parent directory at baz Correspondingly the client\u2019s local database SQLite needed to represent this orphaned state and any component that processed filesystem metadata needed to support it This in turn made it impossible to distinguish many types of serious inconsistencies for example orphaned files from a client merely being in some acceptable transient state In Nucleus the protocol prevents us from getting into this state to begin with In fact one of our core architectural principles is \u201cDesign away invalid system states \u201d In a future post we\u2019ll discuss how we also leverage Rust\u2019s type system to support this principle In the case of the stray cat we report a critical error at the protocol level before the client can enter such a state The persisted data model and higher level components need not consider such a possibility The additional strictness affords a new testable invariant in the database no file or folder can exist even transiently without a parent directory Sync Engine Classic and Nucleus have fundamentally distinct data models The legacy system persists the outstanding work required to sync each file or folder to disk For example it stores whether a given file needs to be created locally or if it needs to be uploaded to the server By comparison Nucleus persists observations Instead of representing the outstanding sync activity directly it maintains just three trees each of which represents an individually consistent filesystem state from which the right sync behavior can be derived The Remote Tree is the latest state of the user\u2019s Dropbox in the cloud The Local Tree is the last observed state of the user\u2019s Dropbox on disk The Synced Tree expresses the last known \u201cfully synced\u201d state between the Remote Tree and Local Tree Sync Engine Classic data model Nucleus data model The Synced Tree is the key innovation that lets us unambiguously derive the correct sync result If you\u2019re familiar with version control you can think of each node in the Synced Tree as a merge base A merge base allows us to derive the direction of a change answering the question \u201cdid the user edit the file locally or was it edited on dropbox com \u201d In the graphic above we can derive that the file at path foo fum was added remotely because the Local Tree on disk matches the merge base expressed by the Synced Tree Without the Synced Tree we wouldn\u2019t be able to distinguish this scenario from if the user had actually deleted foo fum locally We arrived at this data model because it is extremely testable With this data model it is easy to express a key goal of the system to converge all three trees to the same state When the user\u2019s local disk looks the same as dropbox com i e Local Tree matches Remote Tree sync is complete It allows us to enforce strict invariants\u2014for example no matter how the three trees are configured at the beginning of a test all three trees must still converge In the Nucleus data model nodes are represented by a unique identifier This is in stark contrast to Sync Engine Classic which keyed nodes by their full path As a result in the legacy system a rename of a file was represented in the database as a delete at the source path and an add at the destination For folders this meant exploding a single move into O n deletes and adds for all descendants This would then result in a series of successive deletes and adds on disk Until all of a directory\u2019s descendants had been deleted and added one at a time the user would see two inconsistent subtrees In Nucleus the system is stricter Because nodes are represented with a unique identifier a move is just an update to the moved node\u2019s attributes in the database This update is then replicated to the filesystem with a single atomic move providing us with an additional invariant that is enforced in testing\u2014any moved folder is visible in exactly one location Concurrency model The concurrency model of Sync Engine Classic made testing extremely challenging and was another area we were particularly determined to get right the second time around In Sync Engine Classic components were free to fork threads internally This meant that when it came to execution order we were completely at the mercy of the underlying OS Coordination between components was accomplished through a series of global locks Timeouts and backoffs were hard coded As you can imagine this frequently resulted in flaky tests and frustrating debugging To address these testability shortcomings tests often resorted either to sleeping an arbitrary amount of time or to manually serializing execution via invasive patching and mocking In Nucleus we sought to make writing tests as ergonomic and predictable as possible Nearly all of our code runs on a single \u201ccontrol\u201d thread Operations benefiting from concurrency e g network I O filesystem I O and CPU intensive work like hashing are offloaded to dedicated threads or thread pools When it comes to testing we can serialize the entire system Asynchronous requests can be serialized and run on the main thread instead of in the background Say goodbye to flaky tests This single threaded design is the key to the determinism and reproducibility of our randomized testing systems Randomized testing is the most essential part of our testing strategy As with any complex system just when you think you\u2019ve covered all the bases you discover another edge case And another And another Dropbox runs on hundreds of millions of users\u2019 machines each a wildly different environment We often tell new engineers on the team even the most obscure corner cases will show up in the wild Regular unit and integration tests and manual testing simply won\u2019t cut it since humans just aren\u2019t that great at proactively anticipating edge cases Randomized testing is what gives us the confidence that our system is truly robust Depending on your past experiences \u201crandomized testing\u201d might not be your favorite phrase Many randomized testing systems are sources of extreme frustration\u2014failing only intermittently in ways that are impossible to reproduce And when a failure isn\u2019t easily reproducible you have no hope of adding more logging or breakpoints in order to diagnose it In fact Sync Engine Classic had more than a few of these systems We spent many hours poring over randomized testing logs only to find that the logs we really needed simply weren\u2019t present which blocked any further investigation So with Nucleus we were determined to build randomized testing systems that could not only give us the coverage we desired but do so in an ergonomic way The developer experience was paramount To this end we set a challenging requirement for ourselves All randomized testing frameworks must be fully deterministic and easily reproducible In order to provide the desired determinism guarantees all our randomized testing systems share the following structure At the beginning of a random test run generate a random seed Instantiate a pseudorandom number generator PRNG with that seed Personally given its name I like this one Run the test using that PRNG for all random decisions e g generating initial filesystem state task scheduling or network failure injection If the test fails output the seed Every night we run tens of millions of randomized test runs In general they are green on the latest master When a regression sneaks in CI automatically creates a tracking task for each failing seed including also the hash of the latest commit at the time If an engineer needs more logging to understand what happened in the test run they can simply add it inline and re run the test locally It\u2019s guaranteed to fail again In order to uphold this guarantee we take great care to make Nucleus itself fully deterministic provided a fixed PRNG input For example Rust\u2019s default HashMap uses a randomized hashing algorithm under the hood to resist denial of service attacks that can force hash collisions However we don\u2019t need collision resistance in Nucleus since an adversarial user could only degrade their own performance with such an attack So we override this behavior with a deterministic hasher to make sure all behavior is reproducible Note also the importance of the commit hash as another type of \u201ctest input\u201d alongside the seed if the code changes the course of execution may change too In this post we\u2019ll discuss two of the randomized testing systems protecting Nucleus CanopyCheck which tests our ability to bring the three trees into sync and Trinity which tests the concurrency of the engine at large Not all randomized testing must be end to end Building narrowly tailored randomized testing systems to exercise particular components can offer increased coverage and also allow for asserting stronger invariants CanopyCheck is specifically designed to identify bugs in the planner Planner The planner is the core algorithm behind sync at Dropbox As input it takes the three trees\u2014the core of Nucleus\u2019s data model\u2014which together we refer to as \u201cCanopy \u201d Recall that the three trees express the current state of the user\u2019s Dropbox on the server the current state of the user\u2019s Dropbox on disk and a merge base expressing the sync progress made so far The planner\u2019s job is to output a series of operations to incrementally converge the trees For example \u201ccreate this folder on disk \u201d \u201ccommit an edit to this file to the server \u201d etc It batches these operations into groups that are safe to be executed concurrently for example it knows that a file cannot be created until after its parent directory has been created but that it is safe to concurrently edit or delete two sibling files It\u2019s essential that the planning algorithm be correct Here\u2019s an example of a basic handwritten unit test we have for the planner It also shows off how heavily we use Rust\u2019s macro system for testing ergonomics under the hood the planner test macro initializes the trees generates operations according to the planner successively updates the trees to reflect each operation\u2019s result and asserts the final equality property shown as well as some internal consistency properties Copy test fn test remote add planner test initial synced local foo Directory foo bar File contents hello baz Directory initial remote foo Directory foo bar File contents hello foo fum File contents world baz Directory final remote synced local foo Directory foo bar File contents hello foo fum File contents world baz Directory Note The above test verifies that the planner emits an appropriate plan to download a remotely added node As you might expect we have hundreds of tests like this that put the three trees into various configurations and assert that the final state determined by the planner is acceptable But the number of possible non trivially distinct tree configurations is astronomical even if we limit ourselves to small trees How can we be confident that the planner handles all possible inputs appropriately Enter CanopyCheck Initialization CanopyCheck is a testing framework that generates test cases like the example above It randomly generates the initial trees and programmatically infers at least some subset of what the final trees should look like Generating random inputs isn\u2019t trivial if we generated three random trees independently we would fail to exercise interesting scenarios In other words if the three trees had completely disjoint sets of files at non overlapping paths the planner wouldn\u2019t exercise any of its logic for deletes edits moves etc Instead we first randomly generate one tree and then we randomly perturb it to arrive at the other two This better explores the space of all possible sync cases at a high level while still getting good random coverage of the specifics Once we have three trees randomly generated we can start planning Runtime The run loop of a given random CanopyCheck test looks like this Ask the planner for a batch of concurrent operations Randomly shuffle the set of operations to verify that order doesn\u2019t matter For each operation pretend the operation succeeded by updating the trees accordingly Repeat until the planner returns no further operations In step CanopyCheck drives the sync process forward but without actually performing the requested operations\u2014removing any need to mock components or worry about concurrency If everything goes according to plan after some finite number of iterations of this loop all three trees will have converged and we will be synced Invariants The framework looks simple given that it skips out on a lot of the juicy parts of Nucleus like I O and concurrency but it\u2019s quite powerful nevertheless With CanopyCheck we can verify all sorts of invariants Termination Sync is an incremental process First we do one batch of operations then another then another until we\u2019re synced But how do we know that sync will ever terminate What prevents us from accidentally looping and infinitely syncing CanopyCheck verifies that no matter how crazy or contrived the input the planner produces no infinite loops approximately speaking of course using a heuristic cutoff of planning iterations No panics We liberally assert in the planner and throughout Nucleus in general to be as defensive as possible CanopyCheck provides early comprehensive coverage of these asserts assuring us they won\u2019t result in runtime panics in the wild Early on in Nucleus\u2019s development this alone caught an enormous number of bugs exposing flawed assumptions in our design that drove us back to the drawing board In fact it was CanopyCheck that exposed the Archives Drafts January directory cycle bug we described in our previous blog post CanopyCheck was able to find this condition where applying a local move and a remote move together created a cycle The seed then triggered an assertion error within our tree data structure and failed the test Sync correctness We enforce that all three trees are equal at the end of a test run This is the definition of sync But if this is all we enforced we\u2019d be vulnerable to really extreme bugs suppose the planner always went out of its way to blow away everything on dropbox com and on the user\u2019s disk No matter the input we\u2019d always end up with three identical empty trees yet the test would still pass Thus in addition to requiring that all three trees converge we also enforce numerous additional correctness invariants Because these are randomized tests it\u2019s important that the invariants be simple enough to apply in all cases yet aggressive enough to be consequential Typically some ideally simple property of the three trees is derived at initialization and then a related property is enforced at the end of the test For example one invariant we enforce is that if a given file exists only in the Remote Tree but not in the other two trees i e the file is only available on the server then it must exist in all three trees at the end of a test run Intuitively this captures the notion that whenever there\u2019s unsynced data on the server it must be synced down to the user\u2019s disk Deleting it would be an error We enforce the symmetric local invariant for uploads as well Another example invariant pertains to Smart Sync we verify that any locally added file remains downloaded as long as it\u2019s not moved into an \u201conline only\u201d folder This ensures that the planner doesn\u2019t evict local contents from disk prematurely Minimization The name \u201cCanopyCheck\u201d is a reference to QuickCheck a Haskell testing library Like QuickCheck when CanopyCheck finds a failing test case it next attempts to find a minimally complex input that reproduces the failure The test\u2019s simple input format the three trees allows a very natural approach to minimization Suppose a test case failed some of the correctness invariants described above or perhaps it ran for too many iterations suggesting an infinite loop Upon finding the test case CanopyCheck searches for the minimal input by iteratively removing nodes thereby shrinking the trees\u2019 initial state and checking if the failure persists Because the initial randomly generated input is often quite convoluted this process is extremely valuable to us developers Tracking dozens of nodes across three trees is simply not easy for a human to do as the real bug is often hidden alongside many red herrings This minimization removes such distractions often making it much easier to diagnose at a glance that for example \u201coh we\u2019re not handling the case where the user adds a node under a parent directory that was moved remotely \u201d CanopyCheck is very effective at testing our planning algorithm but there is much more to Nucleus that still needs testing coverage This is where Trinity comes in The trickiest bugs in sync are often caused by subtle race conditions appearing only in rare circumstances when operations align with particularly problematic timing or ordering Here\u2019s an example In a shared folder Ada deletes foo on her machine Grace\u2019s sync engine learns that foo should be deleted Simultaneously Grace writes some new data into foo on her computer Grace\u2019s sync engine erroneously deletes foo clobbering her recent change Losing data the user intended to sync to Dropbox must be avoided at all costs Trinity helps us discover races of this sort and of course more complicated ones before deploying our product to users Initialization At the beginning of a run Trinity initializes the backend state i e the user\u2019s Dropbox on dropbox com and filesystem state i e the Dropbox folder on disk Note that here we\u2019re not initializing Nucleus\u2019s data model directly but rather the external state of the system that Nucleus observes and syncs It then instantiates Nucleus akin to a user linking the Dropbox desktop client and selecting a previously existing Dropbox folder on their disk Execution Trinity then alternates between scheduling Nucleus and scheduling itself on the main thread Until Nucleus reports that it has reached a synced state Trinity aggressively agitates the system by modifying the local and remote filesystems intercepting Nucleus\u2019s asynchronous requests and reordering responses injecting filesystem errors and network failures and simulating crashes Verification Once Nucleus reports it\u2019s synced Trinity asserts that the system is in a consistent state Additionally it verifies its own determinism by re running the same test with the same seed and asserting that the same final state is reproduced Mocking Nucleus is parameterized over several compile time dependencies allowing Trinity to pass in wrapped versions of the filesystem network and timer during initialization Trinity uses these wrapped implementations to intercept asynchronous requests and serialize responses If Trinity chooses to satisfy a request it proxies it through to an underlying concrete implementation Filesystem Trinity replaces the native platform filesystem with an in memory mock This mock allows Trinity to inject failures in any filesystem operation to reorder requests and resolve them in whatever order it wants and even to simulate system crashes by snapshotting and restoring old filesystem states Most importantly though using an in memory filesystem provides a huge performance boost allowing for about 10x more test runs and hence more random exploration Network The entire server backend\u2014metadata database file content storage notification services etc \u2014is swapped out for a Rust mock allowing Trinity to arbitrarily reorder delay and fail any RPC to the server The mock emulates all server side services that Nucleus depends upon and mimics production behavior as closely as possible Time The Nucleus codebase uses a generic mockable timer object For example if Nucleus requests a minute timeout for downloading an online only placeholder Trinity can intercept that request fast forward time arbitrarily and fire the timeout whenever it wants Simulating concurrency Thanks to all this mocking Trinity is privy to all asynchronous activity in the system Trinity drives Nucleus on the main thread buffering numerous intercepted requests to each of the mocked components After some time Nucleus passes control back to Trinity at which point Trinity randomly chooses whether to satisfy or fail those requests or to take its own actions to perturb the system\u2019s external state as described under \u201cExecution\u201d above Now you might be thinking \u201chow does Trinity achieve scheduling both itself and Nucleus on the main thread \u201d The answer is that Nucleus itself is a Rust Future and Trinity is essentially a custom executor for that future that allows us to interleave the future\u2019s execution with its own additional custom logic If you\u2019re not already familiar with futures in Rust it may be helpful to check out this excellent overview and or the latest official documentation before we dive deeper in this section Futures are composed of other futures so it makes sense for Nucleus itself to be one giant future Internally it\u2019s composed of numerous other worker futures which are in turn composed of more futures creating a tree like structure For example the \u201cupload worker\u201d is a future responsible for transferring file contents to the Dropbox servers Internally it manages an unordered set of futures representing the concurrent network requests it drives Rust\u2019s Future trait expresses execution via the function poll which causes a future to make some progress and then return whether it\u2019s completed or not If a future returns Poll Ready result it has completed with output result If it returns Poll Pending it is blocked on one of its child futures and an external party is responsible for calling poll again when any of those child futures have made progress The top level Nucleus future has the type impl Future The is Rust for \u201cthe uninhabited type \u201d meaning it can only ever return Poll Pending However each poll invocation on a future still allows its subsystems to make progress During testing Trinity is the external party in charge of polling that top level sync engine future In its main run loop Trinity alternates between running its own code calling poll on Nucleus and calling poll on all mocked filesystem and network requests that it intercepted When Nucleus becomes blocked on one or more outstanding requests Trinity chooses some to either succeed or fail driven as always by the PRNG This not only simulates the concurrency Nucleus would normally experience in production but also amplifies the probability of less likely execution orderings Limitations While Trinity is great at finding unexpected interactions between different components internal to Nucleus mocking out so many external sources of nondeterminism comes at a cost Native filesystem interactions Our native platform layers are themselves fairly complex including OS specific logic to manage permissions modify extended file attributes hydrate Smart Sync placeholders and so on When running Trinity against our in memory filesystem mock we lose all coverage of this area To cover this layer of our codebase we also run Trinity in a \u201cnative\u201d mode targeting the platform\u2019s actual filesystem However running against the native filesystem incurs a huge performance penalty roughly 10x which in turn means Trinity Native can\u2019t test as many different seeds In order to deliver on its reproducibility promises Trinity serializes all calls into the native platform APIs to avoid any nondeterminism that could arise from the OS interleaving system calls Of course real users can make system calls whenever they want so such interleavings could very well be a source of race conditions in the wild Lastly some platform behavior is still out of scope Trinity cannot actually reboot the machine mid test so it can\u2019t validate that we use fsync in all the right places to ensure crash durability on each platform Network protocol Mocking out all of Dropbox\u2019s server architecture might hide any number of bugs in the real client server communication protocol Given the complexity of our production environment there is high risk that our mock\u2019s behavior may drift from reality On the other hand mocking out the network allows Trinity to run quickly and independent of connectivity issues To test the protocol we have a separate test suite called Heirloom Heirloom operates on the same deterministic random seed principle for controlling the client\u2019s execution but because it necessarily talks to a real Dropbox server over the network it must trade off some determinism guarantees And due to the overhead of this approach communicating across multiple language boundaries and through our full backend stack Heirloom runs about 100x slower than Trinity How exactly Heirloom works is a subject for a future blog post Minimization Another tradeoff Trinity makes is that because it mocks out less of the system than CanopyCheck does it cannot minimize failing test cases as easily The more of Nucleus\u2019s complex emergent behavior we try to validate the less we can perturb any given test\u2019s input without making its behavior totally diverge Even a small change to the three trees\u2019 initial state might change the order of network request scheduling down the line and thereby invalidate a failing random seed\u2014hard won at the cost of many CPU days We\u2019re currently thinking about how to solve this problem e g by decoupling the global PRNG into several independent ones but for now the developer must analyze the scenario themself inserting new logging and fine tuning their grep filter to focus on what\u2019s most relevant in the trace Ultimately any verification effort faces some limitations to how much coverage it can offer We maintain several other test suites in our CI that run at higher levels of abstraction which trade off Trinity\u2019s ease of use and performance in order to provide some admittedly weaker end to end coverage for whatever lies outside Trinity\u2019s scope But when it comes to testing Nucleus itself Trinity allows us to deploy our production builds with a level of confidence that we never would have dreamed of with Sync Engine Classic Focusing on testability from the get go with Nucleus allowed us to build fully deterministic randomized testing systems like CanopyCheck and Trinity The target of our rewrite had over a decade to stabilize meaning we needed to avoid regressing years of bug fixes But thanks to these test frameworks we were able to safely get it done And now the heart powering Dropbox sync is stronger than ever \u2764\ufe0f Special thanks to Ben Blum and Sujay Jayakar for contributions and to Geoff Song John Lai Liam Whelan

Delays General At the same time it dawned on IVAS program officials that the digital thermal sensors in IVAS could be adapted to detect a fever according to an Army Futures Command news release A week ago we were talking about the potential impacts of the pandemic on the IVAS program today we re talking about the potential impacts of IVAS on the pandemic Brig Gen Dave Hodne the director of the Army Future Command s Soldier Lethality Cross Functional Team and Infantry Commandant at Fort Benning Georgia said in a statement Now soldiers are using the IVAS prototypes to take the temperatures of hundreds of soldiers each day as they prepare for training at Benning an installation that hosts thousands of soldiers going through courses such as infantry one station unit training and Ranger School That s the genius of this system we can use this technology today to fight the virus even as we shape it into the combat system our soldiers need tomorrow Brig Gen Tony Potts who commands Program Executive Office Soldier at Fort Belvoir Virginia said in a statement Tom Bowman the director of IVAS Science Technology Special Project Office with the C5ISR s Night Vision Laboratory at Belvoir came up with the idea of tweaking the IVAS software to detect a fever Bowman and his team of experts trained soldiers from the 1st Battalion 29th Infantry Regiment to use the goggles to take troops temperatures The IVAS prototypes currently being used are not the ruggedized versions soldiers will test this fall so they can only be used for fever screening indoors Each day hundreds of soldiers have filed through a processing center where they paused for five seconds so a soldier wearing IVAS goggles could detect their forehead and inner eye temperatures The soldier s temperature registered in the operator s see through heads up display a method that proves more economical and sanitary than the use of traditional thermometers according to the release The process takes about minutes to clear roughly soldiers according to the release which added that anyone who registered a fever was moved to an onsite medical station for evaluation We ve always planned for an agile

historical example of an unstoppable force hitting an immovable object than the Soviet invasion and occupation of Afghanistan Afghanistan is a mountainous landlocked harsh country that makes it very difficult for a great power to bring the full might of that power to bear against the locals Naval forces are out and in some area so is air support The harsh climate and vast nothingness and remotely populated areas makes supply lines difficult to establish and even harder to defend But the Soviet Union opted to try anyway invading in force in Under Afghan King Mohammed Zahir Shah the country was actually developing and modernizing fairly well\u2026 until his cousin Mohammed Daoud Khan overthrew him in He established an Afghan Republic and everything went to hell \u2014 for many reasons Five years later the Pashtun Nationalist government was overthrown in favor of a Communist regime and Afghanistan became a Cold War battlefront Communism did not sit well with the people in rural areas who weren\u2019t used to the control and taxes and land reforms of a Communist central government So they started fighting back Then President Nur Mohammed Taraki asked the Soviet Union to help quell angry protests against a government that suddenly decided to execute so many of them for failing to comply with Communist reforms That\u2019s when Hafizullah Amin the Communist Prime Minister killed Taraki and seized power Then Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev stepped in He came in like a wrecking ball People like this Seeing Afghanistan descending into chaos and worried that the Islamic Revolution in Iran might spread to Afghanistan and other traditionally muslim Soviet Socialist Republics the USSR decided to move in \u2014 and pretty much failed from day one which was Christmas Day At this point the Soviets needed to do four things legitimize the Communist central government in Kabul rebuild the Afghan Army destroy resistance to the new government and win the hearts and minds of the common people they couldn\u2019t directly control \u201cOwnership\u201d being the operative word They could not establish the Communist government\u2019s legitimacy Failure was immediate beginning with the man at the top After just months in power Amin was out Literally One of the first governmental changes the Soviets made was to kill Amin and replace him with Babrak Kamal This turned the image of the Soviet invasion from one of an intervention to stabilize the government to one of ownership over Afghanistan These guys remember They did not break the back of the resistance While they were able to take the major cities as well as transportation and communications centers the Red Army quickly pushed tribal warlords into the mountainous regions where they resolved to begin the Islamic Revolution that nobody had thought about until the Soviets invaded in the first place Instead of conquering the country they managed to unite Afghanistan\u2019s disparate population against them There\u2019s no Russian translation for \u201coff the beaten path \u201d Apparently The one advantage the Red Army had over mujahideen fighters was their fleet of Hind helicopters These allowed the Soviets to move people and equipment fast over long distances and into the high mountains This silver lining lasted until the mid 1980s when Stinger missiles began to appear in jihadi arsenals With accurate anti aircraft missiles the mujahideen now had the ability to protect their mountainous hiding places and forced the Soviet Union to switch to a tactic of conducting nighttime raiding on enemy targets Soviet forces were concentrated in a mass along major highways in the country and in a series of fortified positions throughout their controlled areas Outside of those areas neither economy of forces nor consistent supply lines were ever established A map of areas controlled by insurgent groups in Afghanistan in In places like Khost Soviet dominance was never even established The Red Army established a helicopter base on the outskirts of the city but the city itself spent years under siege from the Mujahideen forces cut off from the rest of Soviet operations When a relief column came to the base in they reset the siege as soon as the Russians left The Soviet Union\u2019s previous experience with invading other countries was limited to East Germany Hungary and Czechoslovakia Afghanistan and its people have little in common with the methods of fighting that work in Europe The tactics employed by the Soviets were mostly of overwhelming firepower including scorched earth policies carpet bombing and the use of chemical weapons none of which won them many friends among the people of the country they were trying to win over Soviet ground forces in action while conducting an offensive operation against the Islamist resistance the Mujahideen The Soviets did not win over the hearts and minds of Afghan people A narrative quickly formed that atheist Communists and traditionally Orthodox Christian Russian invaders were on a mission against Islam Those Afghan warlords that were pushed out of major urban centers and villages came down from the mountains as a united Islamic front the mujahideen With the Cold War in full swing the United States decided to help fuel the fire by supplying the mujahideen with weapons and equipment to help their jihad against the USSR Fighters and money flowed into the mujahideen\u2019s ongoing guerrilla war against the Soviet Union from all corners of the Islamic world Between and the Red Army stomped the mujahideen in a series of battles in the Panjshir Valley against the forces of rebel leaders like Ahmad Shah Massoud But Massoud would always live to rebuild his forces and come back at the Russian bear The Soviets could win as many pitched battles as they wanted kill as many Afghan fighters as possible but the endless tide of money and men would mean that the battles would just be fought over and over Search and destroy missions were not going to pacify Afghanistan In fact all it did was either kill the population or turned them into refugees \u2014 a full one third of Afghanistan\u2019s population was killed or fled during the Soviet occupation \u201cSet it up like this it goes bang Good work comrade \u201d The Afghan Army was never an effective force The Red Army brought in allied advisors from friendly countries to train the Afghan Army in warfighting methods more appropriate than the methods they actually used Cuban troops who were familiar with insurgency operations from places like Angola and Ethiopia trained the burgeoning Afghan government troops but the consistent lack of actual combat experience in these tactics wasted a lot of the time they could have spent creating a veteran fighting force Furthermore the inefficient communications and logistics involved with large scale Soviet operations did little to convince the nascent Afghan troops that their training methods and lessons had any real applicability in real world fighting When the Russians left and the Soviet Union fell many of these trained fighters defected to the mujahideen leading to the fall of the Afghan Communist regime The Soviet Union would stay in Afghanistan until February They still supported the Communist Afghan government against the mujahideen which continued until the USSR collapsed in on itself in In April mujahideen troops under Ahmad Shah Massoud captured Kabul But the factional violence within the jihadists didn\u2019t stop and another civil war began This time the victors were an upstart group of hardline Islamists known as the Taliban More on We are the Mighty", "page_url": "https://www.wearethemighty.com/military-culture/mark-harper-podcast", "label": 1,

wrote how to interview engineers when you re not technical Given how popular this post was I decided to publish a second round of questions that founders and managers can use during interviews Remember the goal is to ask questions that surface understanding about engineering culture and attitude Given you can t asses technical ability through programming quizzes or by reviewing code you must judge the engineer s mastery of software process and communication Here are the most popular follow ups from my own experience and those of readers \u200d \u200d How do you unblock yourself if no one is around to help Key to an engineer s success is the ability to unstick oneself However an engineer can be stuck on what seems to be a trivial bug for days and even weeks Debugging in software is a process that varies in difficulty How easy or hard it is to solve has nothing to do with the bug itself either In programming complex problems can have simple solutions But the opposite is also true Simple problems can have horribly complex solutions Case in point web styling and CSS Ever notice a difference in how certain components look between browsers like Google Chrome and Internet Explorer Well there are thousands of lines of code written by engineers just to make design patterns compatible across both They don t always work either For most engineers the majority of their hours are spent debugging code like this browser example rather than writing new code They are reading Stack Overflow pair programming asking for code review and searching for open source tools to resolve problems they encounter As a manager you might think that s crazy How could anyone call themselves a professional and be paid six figures when over half their day is just googling how to fix something that doesn t work An engineer s ability to debug code can vary just like their ability to write code You could argue they are the same skill writing and debugging but engineers think of them as separate Reading code is very different from writing it \u200d The very best engineers have a checklist they apply depending on the type of bug Spelling mistake Nope Wrong file Nope Wrong environment Nope Import error Yes They repeat their checklist for every bug they hit and grow their list over time They also use tools to help them debug like ipdb for Python Valgrind for C and countless others for different languages and frameworks \u200d If an engineer has a coherent strategy or demonstrated experience for how they would unstick themselves they deserve strong consideration to be a part of your team \u200d What does done mean to you as an engineer Regardless about the amount of time debugging how else is a developer s time spent How does a developer know when they re done with a problem \u200d Done is a nebulous word for engineers It s an opinion to them but a yes or no answer to everyone who depends on them An engineer can always write more tests refactor and simplify their code document their work with comments and update the README For some engineers done means getting their code working But does it look good Not quite Is it fast Not at all There s always more work to do Done can mean many things So defining this is your responsibility as a manager Finding an engineer who has an articulate description aligned with your interpretation is worth their weight in gold \u200d \u200d \u200d Could you talk about an app or program you built to solve a problem for yourself Programmers are unique They re one of the few professions where outside the boundaries of their working hours they choose to do the same exact thing they do at work programming Earlier in my career I spent hours on weekends late nights and early mornings building things It was all voluntary because programming is addicting It didn t matter how silly or important the problem I was solving with my code It was fun And many engineers build apps that solve fun problems in their free time There are countless ways engineers choose to spend their off hours Some contribute to open source Others take online classes Some are tutors and others work a second job as a freelancer Asking about side projects is the best way to learn about their enthusiasm for code It s OK too if an engineer doesn t have any side projects There s a stigma I don t always agree with associated with side hustles Having side projects is a plus not a requirement Your candidate doesn t have to always be programming to be a good candidate But if they do the sign of true engineer is one can build tools not just one off solutions Software tools require a degree of flexibility and planning and a level of abstraction not commonly found What s the difference between a solution and a tool A solution is something the engineer can use for themselves A tool is something both they and others can use Open sourcing home grown projects is the sign of true mastery \u200d \u200d How would you find interview and hire other engineers to join our team \u200d After your first technical hire you should delegate the task of finding new talent to that individual You should still have the final say on hiring if you re the sole founder of your company though But delegating is key Why not even ask in the interview process how they would be hiring if the roles were switched There is a lot of solid hiring advice for startups Hire slowly You should always feel the pain of not having enough team members before adding another Fire fast The one regret founders cite most is letting bad employees stick around too long My addition to this wisdom hire a team that builds itself Asking potential candidates how they would find the best talent and grow the team demonstrates trust There s no greater responsibility than having the ability to decide who s accepted into the tribe and who s not Communicating this early shows you re serious and it also tests their ego You can measure a candidate s maturity by how they respond if asked how would you hire someone for the same role if we hire you or even a manager for a role above you not yet filled This touches on a perfectly worded quote by Arthur Conan Doyle Mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself but talent instantly recognizes genius Simplified talent recognizes talent and is not intimidated by it Find engineers who feed off the positive energy of others \u200d \u200d What s the one thing you would not compromise on as you write code \u200d As a developer writes software there are tradeoffs at every step Some programs that take weeks to build can also be written in just a few hours if you know what shortcuts to take How do you find a balance of speed and quality It comes down to your long term pain tolerance If an engineer has no regard for writing tests documentation or refactoring code their work will morph into a Gordian knot of software known as duct tape or bandaid code I ll go back and fix this later becomes the status quo and never actually happens To some engineers this is standard Others are more methodical making time as they work to refactor and abstract Some joke that reading others code is more difficult than writing your own so deleting software that s not yours becomes easier than adding to it Ask your engineer what they are not willing to compromise on What must be part of each Sprint they complete so as to not go crazy later It could be test coverage code syntax formatting or even cleaning up merge requests and maintaining branch hygiene Whatever it is ask your candidate what is important to them and why If they don t have an answer it s a warning \u200d Concluding Thoughts Hiring is tricky It s especially hard if you don t have mastery of the skill you re interviewing candidates for Imposter syndrome sinks in Am I even qualified to be doing this Maybe not But who cares You have the questions to surface everything else that is important about hiring a team of engineers And once you hire the first one you ll have help the rest of the way If you liked this story follow me on Twitter for more \u200d \u200d \u200d \u200d \u200d", "page_url":

lockdown Instead she was left incommunicado as her line was cancelled and her phone number reallocated During the following four weeks as she pleaded in vain to be reconnected her partner contracted Covid He died four days later in hospital Due to the blunders by Now TV he was unable to call Parry from his deathbed and she was unable to say goodbye The news was broken by a relative as the hospital could not get through on her cancelled number \u201cNow TV\u2019s failed promises have left a year old woman grieving for a lost loved one completely on her own with friends and family unable to contact her \u201d says her son in law Anthony \u201cThe day after her partner died the company reneged on a promise to retrieve her old number and said it was not possible Instead of promised call backs we\u2019ve had auto generated emails asking why we cancelled the contract and I\u2019ve spent over seven fruitless hours on the phone explaining it was a life and death situation and trying to get her connected \u201d Coronavirus has turned telecoms into a lifeline Service delays that would once have been an inconvenience can now prove catastrophic Figures from the Office of National Statistics show that of people cited phone and internet contact as the most common coping strategy However service providers are struggling with some companies losing up to of staff to sickness and self isolation Ofcom which regulates the industry has eased some of the obligations of telecoms firms to reflect the challenges They are absolved from having to fix problems within the usual day window for customers receiving less than their guaranteed broadband speed and automatic compensation introduced last year for each day of delay to a repair or installation Companies are expected to explain to customers why they will not receive a payout and to stop charging those without a service \u201cBroadband and mobile firms are focusing their efforts on keeping their customers connected particularly those who are vulnerable and depend on their services the most \u201d Ofcom says \u201cWe think this is absolutely the right approach And we recognise this might affect the companies\u2019 ability to comply with some of our rules We have written to the providers explaining that we will take account of the unique circumstances when enforcing our rules \u201d In the current climate we are both classed as extremely vulnerable but in an emergency have no means of contacting anyone The problem is that customers with mental or physical impairments had to be registered as vulnerable with their service providers in order to be prioritised before the pandemic Now anyone self isolating due to age or a medical condition falls into that category but may not be flagged up on their provider\u2019s database Pensioners Colin and Anne Noddings found that their landline had been disconnected after Vodafone installed a broadband service They were told it would take days to restore and Colin had to borrow mobile phones from neighbours to call for updates Three days later the couple was informed that their contract had been cancelled for reasons unknown and the phone number they\u2019d had for years withdrawn It would take an estimated days to reconnect them \u201cMy year old wife is classed as disabled as her mobility is extremely limited and I have a heart condition diabetes and have recently been diagnosed with asthma and COPD \u201d says Colin \u201cIn the current climate we are both classed as extremely vulnerable but in an emergency have no means of contacting anyone \u201d Ofcom says it expects companies to provide self isolating customers alternative means of communication if their issue can\u2019t be prioritised However Vodafone only acted when the Observer intervened It reinstated the line and the original number days after the couple were disconnected and has given them \u00a3 and two months free line rental Charlotte Hughes lost her internet connection in January after a cable to her flat was severed Virgin Media claimed it was unable to reconnect her because of scaffolding on the council block where she lives The inconvenience for the first two months when lack of wifi impeded her search for a job turned to hardship when lockdown began a week after she underwent surgery for cancer She was unable to order food online and had to risk trips to the supermarket despite an NHS letter requiring her to shield and she was unable to seek comfort from friends and family \u201cSkype is the main way I connect and I simply cannot say what it meant not to have a reliable enough connection to talk to people \u201d she says \u201cThis was especially difficult at a time of diagnosis and pre and post operative treatment for cancer I was told that the cable had been severed by a Virgin Media technician connecting a neighbouring flat but the company displays no sense of urgency or responsibility and clearly has no reliable mechanism for communicating between departments or flagging up unresolved problems \u201d We\u2019ve never been more reliant on broadband and mobile phone networks but our data suggests some firms are falling short Virgin Media says that it believed the cable was severed by builders and that health and safety risks prevented it reinstating the line while scaffolding was in place After involvement from the Observer however it dispatched a \u201cspecialist crew\u201d and completed the repair It has credited Hughes\u2019 account for the weeks she was without service and given her an extra two months free The online resolution service Resolver reports a doubling of complaints about telecoms service issues since lockdown \u201cMost people are pragmatic enough to expect service disruptions and slow speeds but they weren\u2019t expecting poor customer service \u201d says spokesperson Martyn James \u201cWe\u2019ve never been more reliant on broadband and mobile phone networks but our data suggests some firms are falling short \u201d Customers who are self isolating or in financial straits are advised to contact their provider to receive priority status If that fails they can still complain to whichever of the two dispute resolution schemes it\u2019s signed up to \u2013 CISAS or Ombudsman Services These are prioritising those who are left without a connection because of delayed installation a faulty line or inability to pay their bill Other complaints will be parked until there is a degree of normality Parry\u2019s ordeal was caused by disjointed customer service and a failure to escalate the problem When the Observer alerted the management of Now TV part of Sky Group the response was immediate and remorseful The director of operations called her to apologise her old phone number was retrieved and her line connected Managing Director Marina Storti says \u201cWe take our responsibility to keep customers informed and connected very seriously especially in these challenging times and we know we\u2019ve let the customer and her family down We\u2019ve spoken to the family and while we know that no amount of money can make things right we have met the request of compensation and offered to match it with a donation to a charity of their choice \u201d The company\u2019s contrition is some mollification but the anguish of losing a loved one without a farewell will never heal \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put into words how much greater the misery has been because of the mistakes \u201d Parry says \u201cThey let me down in the first place and they let me down again when we tried to sort it out I\u2019m a Christian and I believe in forgiveness but this is very tough for me \u201d Names have been changed",

water cleaning technology that sounds like something straight out of a superhero origin story a plasma reactor that doesn t remove chemical contaminants from the water supply it totally destroys them leaving the water safe to drink without generating toxic waste the service says The Air Force on Tuesday announced the first field demonstration of the Enhanced Contact Plasma Reactor which uses water electricity and argon gas to degrade and destroy target PFAS per and polyfluoroalkyl substances chemicals in minutes The test conducted under an Air Force Civil Engineer Center AFCEC contract with Clarkson University treated hundreds of gallons of groundwater at Wright Patterson Air Force Base over a two week period and gave engineers time to experiment with different durations and flows to optimize efficiency the Air Force said in its press release The reactors are a response to a growing PFAS water contamination problem at military bases across the country PFAS chemicals are a critical part of the firefighting foams used by the military since the 1970s which leached into the water supply over the course of several decades The chemicals have been linked to cancer fertility problems liver damage high cholesterol and other health problems scientists say and they re extremely persistent in the environment and in the human body which means they don t break down over time In January Congress created a task force to figure out new means to address the contamination which officials say will cost more than billion to address But fully extracting PFAS from a target water supply is a major engineering challenge and it could take years for the task force to simply to get a handle on what needs to be done That s where the plasma reactor comes in the result of a AFCEC initiative to develop efficient sustainable groundwater clean up solutions the reactor doesn t separate the two most researched compounds within the PFAS group PFOS and PFOA from a target water supply it eliminates them entirely \u201cThe argon gas concentrates PFAS at the gas liquid interface and plasma is generated at that interface which then destroys PFAS \u201d explained Dr Selma Mededovic The plasma then breaks down PFAS molecules into smaller components without the need for any extra chemicals or additives Mededovic said \u201cThis is the only technology that actually destroys PFAS molecules that has been demonstrated at this scale it doesn t just remove them from water \u201d said Dr Tom Holsen also of Clarkson University \u201cAll of the other demonstrations that we re aware of remove it from the water through filtration so there is still a PFAS containing waste Our method actually destroys PFAS \u201d Professors Selma Mededovic Thagard and Thomas Holsen the Clarkson University team responsible developing the enhanced contact electrical discharge plasma reactor \u2013 a new method for degrading poly and perfluoroalkyl substances including PFOS and PFOA \u2013 pose for a photo Clarkson University The point of the demonstration was to transition the reactor technology from the laboratory to the field the Air Force said According to researchers the next steps will be to write a detailed analysis of the treated water and figure out how to scale up the plasma reactor design for larger projects \u201cPFOS PFOA is a national issue and research like this could lead to the breakthroughs we need to address potential contamination \u201d said Mark Correll Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Installations Energy and the Environment in the Air Force press

increasingly become an important domain for warfare with the U S and other countries such as Russia and China stepping up their military postures in low Earth orbit and near the moon Experts say that anti satellite weapons that shatter their targets pose a space hazard by creating a cloud of fragments that can collide with other objects potentially setting off a chain reaction of projectiles through Earth orbit The United States is ready and committed to deterring aggression and defending the nation our allies and U S interests from hostile acts in space General John Raymond the commander of U S Space Command said in a statement Political Cartoons on World Leaders Raymond added that the test was proof of Russia s hypocritical advocacy of outer space arms control proposals while clearly having no intention of halting their counterspace weapons programs Russian airspace notices indicate the test was conducted around Wednesday morning It did not appear that the mobile missile system was targeting any satellites in space based on public satellite data according to analysts The test was of Russia s new Nudol anti satellite missile system analysts projected launching from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome about km miles north of Moscow The U S military is increasingly dependent on satellites to determine what it does on the ground guiding munitions with space based lasers and

Why doesn't anybody seem to care? - The Conversation AU", "text": "On April the US Department of Defense issued a public statement authorising the release of three \u201cUFO\u201d videos taken by US Navy pilots The footage appears to depict airborne heat emitting objects with no visible wings fuselage or exhaust performing aerodynamically in ways that no known aircraft can achieve The DoD doesn\u2019t use the terms \u201cunidentified flying object\u201d or \u201cUFO\u201d but does clearly state \u201cthe aerial phenomena observed in the videos remain characterized as \u2018unidentified\u2019 \u201d Thoughts about what UFOs are vary widely \u2013 from illusions to alien spacecraft However a workable conservative definition is \u201cintelligently controlled airborne objects not apparently made by humans\u201d Only a small fraction of UFO reports collected globally over the past seven decades seem to describe such objects but the Navy footage appears to fit the bill Whether such objects are vehicles of alien invasion or not their mere presence would seem to indicate a national security threat which is partly what makes the Pentagon\u2019s recent announcement so puzzling This is the first time the Pentagon has publicly confirmed the authenticity of UFO footage It should have been a momentous announcement but it seems to have barely moved the needle on the UFO controversy Why Read more Are we alone The question is worthy of serious scientific study The announcement is new but the videos are not The three grainy monochrome infrared videos \u2013 one taken in November the other two in January \u2013 had already been leaked online in and respectively They also gained international attention after the New York Times published them as part of a December expos\u00e9 on the Pentagon\u2019s secret UFO research program the so called \u201cAdvanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program\u201d VIDEO The three videos released by the US Department of Defense show \u2018unidentified aerial phenomena\u2019 That program was allegedly headed by Luis Elizondo who claims to have been instrumental in the leaks although his background has been credibly called into question After resigning from the DoD Elizondo immediately joined To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science a UFO research collective founded by former Blink frontman Tom DeLonge In September Joseph Gradisher claiming the title of \u201cspokesman for the deputy chief of naval operations for information warfare \u201d confirmed the authenticity of all three videos in an email to a well known UFO blog called The Black Vault This development was quickly reported by the Washington Post The UFO footage in question then has appeared less like a shot out of the blue and more like an echo in the night Its gradual staggered confirmation by the DoD mirrors the entrance of the footage itself into the public consciousness Whether this happened by accident or design we may never know As the technoculture critic Richard Thieme has astutely observed \u201cthe UFO world is a hall of mirrors The UFO world on the internet is a simulation of a hall of mirrors \u201d Not ordinary but not entirely invented Despite the maddening refractions of the UFO rabbit hole we can be certain of one thing The modern figure of the UFO maintains an uneasy residence on \u201cthe margins of the real\u201d UFOs are clearly not ordinary objects like rocks chairs or smartphones But neither are they utterly immaterial products of the cultural imagination like werewolves vampires or fairies If as historian of science M Norton Wise has argued \u201cto make something visible is to make it real or to try to\u201d then the question of whether UFOs exist or not largely hinges on debates about representation and authenticity When it comes to phenomena that may not fit into our framework of what is real \u2013 phenomena like UFOs \u2013 what kind of representations of them will we regard as authentic More specifically what would an authentic representation of a UFO look like Who would have the authority to afford it that authenticity And how would that authentication proceed What would \u2018legitimate\u2019 UFO footage look like In her widely influential polemic On Photography Susan Sontag observed \u201cthe images that have virtually unlimited authority in a modern society are mainly photographic images and the scope of that authority stems from the properties peculiar to images taken by cameras\u201d Within this paradigm even the poorest photograph is always more \u201clegitimate\u201d than the most refined and accurate painting The Navy UFO footage is presented as something more than a photograph however It is offered as professional data collected by highly skilled practitioners Even if we fail to fully understand everything on the plane\u2019s Advanced Targeting Forward Looking Infrared ATFLIR display or even how the video was made it seems data driven and authentic \u2013 an impression reiterated by the grainy monochrome quality of the image itself As observers we are led to believe that despite the somewhat visually disappointing resolution we are watching authentic footage In a way the visual disappointment helps to qualify the videos as candidates for legitimacy Even though few of us know what such a video \u201cshould\u201d look like we assume that since UFO encounters are spontaneous and surprising footage is likely to be somewhat less than satisfactory These expectations present a dilemma If an image of a UFO is too clear it is likely to be read as obviously fake but if it\u2019s too blurry it could be anything A superficial reading of the Navy UFO footage would likely lead to the latter evaluation But given the nature of the footage it is infrared not technically photographic so establishes the heat signature of the objects depicted and the institutional context the Pentagon is not known for producing and distributing fake UFO videos it\u2019s hard to avoid concluding the footage shows genuine physical anomalies If that\u2019s the case it would be worthy of serious scientific and military attention both of which currently seem absent Read more Why are people starting to believe in UFOs again \u2018A hell of a video\u2019 UFOs can be difficult and uncomfortable to think about As I have argued elsewhere one symptom of that difficulty is that individuals and institutions maintain their own ignorance of the situation A persistent trope in Western UFO mythology is that every American president is briefed on the reality of the situation on taking office The current president and commander in chief of the US Armed Forces Donald Trump commented on the recently released footage \u201cI just wonder if it\u2019s real That\u2019s a hell of a video \u201d It was a rare unifying statement from a notoriously divisive and antagonistic president perhaps encapsulating the most likely public reaction to this latest instalment in the UFO mystery just wonder", "page_url": "https://theconversation.com/the-us-military-has-officially-published-three-ufo-videos-why-doesnt-anybody-seem-to-care-137498",

programming language about a career spanning four decades the evolution of Go over the last ten years and into the future The Interview Evrone Unlike many developers today you started your career decades ago at Bell Labs What\u2019s been the biggest change in the way we develop software that you can think of given your rare perspective Rob The scale is much bigger today Not just of the computers and the network but the programs themselves All of Unix version circa fits comfortably on a single RK05 disk pack which has just over 2MB of storage with lots of room left over for user software And that was a fine computing environment or at least seemed like one at the time Although I can of course explain much of the growth it is astonishing and perhaps not all of it is justified Evrone Given the resistance to change and promise of compatibility ideas how do you see the next years for the Go programming language and its ecosystem What is the best future you envision for your technology Rob Although it s far from certain after over a decade of work it looks like a design for parametric polymorphism what is colloquially but misleadingly called generics is coming in the next year or two It was a very hard problem to find a design that works within the existing language and feels as if it belongs but Ian Taylor invested a phenomenal amount of energy into the problem and it looks like the answer is now in reach How that affects the libraries the ecosystem and the community will be fascinating to watch Evrone With gradual typing being introduced into dynamically typed languages and type inference into statically typed the line between two is now blurred What is your opinion on a type system for a modern programming language Rob I am a big fan of static typing because of the stability and safety it brings I am a big fan of dynamic typing because of the fun and lightweight feel it brings As a side note the big push for integrated unit testing can be credited to languages like Python which drove testing to demonstrate correctness that the typing system failed to provide I am not a fan of type driven programming type hierarchies and classes and inheritance Although many hugely successful projects have been built that way I feel the approach pushes important decisions too early into the design phase before experience can influence it In other words I prefer composition to inheritance However I say to those who are comfortable using inheritance to structure their programs pay no attention and please continue to use what works for you Evrone Sometimes people use technologies in strange ways For example to generate efficient Go code from the high level Python or Ruby code yes we saw that happening Over the years what is the strangest most creative or amusing Go usage have you seen What surprised you the most Rob The biggest surprise was when we learned that Go was being used to write malware You can t control who will use your work or what they will do with it Evrone You created a number of text editors What do you think about the Visual Studio code With technologies like LSP the line between text editor and IDE is blurred now Do you think software developers need full featured IDEs like GoLand or using VSCode is fine Rob I am from a different time before IDEs but there was talk early in the project about whether Go needed an IDE to succeed No one on the team had the right skill set though so we did not try to create one However we did create core libraries for parsing and printing Go code which soon enabled high quality plugins for all manner of editor and IDE and that was a serendipitous success More recently we ve been working hard on an LSP server for Go called gopls which can be used by any editor or IDE that supports that protocol to improve the experience working with the language Perhaps because of our comfort working with simpler styles of editor we made sure that one could work comfortably in Go without heavy lifting from the programming environment An IDE can certainly help though most of those I see working in Go today use one or at least an editor with custom Go support and get much value from it The question of what style of editor to use is a matter of taste colored by the culture of the language you work in Evrone Software developers tend to label things such as Dart being a frontend language and C being a system low level language and so on How would you term the Go programming language now given its feature set and usage Rob Go is a general purpose programming language Write whatever you want in it and don t worry about pinning the language or any other technology for that matter to a single problem domain Evrone What other modern programming languages do you personally like Rob The Go experience has taught me that people love to opine about languages perhaps more than almost any other element of our field And I have certainly done so myself But I am tired of the negativity that often results so now I try to avoid judging things for others There has been a real renaissance in language design over the last years or so after a period where very few new languages were arriving and succeeding It s great to see this and the innovation it brings Evrone How does being a Google employee help you develop and guide the Go language How important is it to be able to ask tell us how you use our language on Twitter and get responses from the biggest companies all over the world Is it just a nice addition or an essential part of language development How does Google help you Rob Google has been very generous in its support for the Go project for which I am very grateful And of course the language was created because we thought Google needed it what became called cloud computing needed a language with good support for concurrency and easy deployment among other things But Google has not directed the project in any significant way It supports us and lets us do what we think is best Regarding other companies and other users input from the community is a vital part of understanding how the project by which I mean the language compiler tools runtime library environment \u2014 all of it \u2014 advances Evrone After years of Go development and observing how it is used what can you name the biggest design success and opposite biggest design failure for the language It s strongest and weakest points respectively Rob I would like to call out two things one technical and one political The technical one is first class support for concurrent computation Go is only a decade or so old but when it was being developed threading and concurrency were not widely appreciated in the programming community In fact a major reason for creating Go was the difficulty of doing concurrent computation in C at the time It became clear shortly after launch that the concurrency support was a major attraction one that compensated for what some felt were weaknesses in other parts of the language Concurrency struck a nerve And once people played with the concurrency they started exploring the other things about the language and learned that there was more there than they originally thought Support for concurrency was the gateway As John Graham Cumming of Cloudflare says I came for the easy concurrency I stayed for the easy composition Go changed the conversation around how to program multicore computers The political success was the firm promise made about compatibility for Go version Once we and the community had used Go for a few years we had a long list of things we wanted to fix but change is disruptive So we did a careful program of updates with the go fix command to pull the community along and once that was done not only did we stop we promised to stay stopped That stability \u2014 Go programs written in will still compile and run perfectly today \u2014 was a huge enabler for growth Companies could use the language with confidence that we would not break their software The adoption rate increased dramatically after version and its compatibility promise appeared And although we have since learned of many other things we would like to change we can t break existing programs and we are fine with that Evrone What does your work life balance look like There are lots of talks about burn outs right now and the epidemic situation does not help at all Any hints from your year journey for new generations of developers Rob The best way to avoid burnout is to do something you truly enjoy in an environment that supports you I ve been very lucky in that regard through my whole career but I realize not everyone is as fortunate If you re feeling stressed by work you should feel free to take a break or change direction especially in our current situation Evrone In hindsight the popularity of many technologies is credited to so called killer apps that made them popular Can you name such a killer app s for the Go programming language and what do you think about such a killer app idea as a whole Rob A few years ago Danny Berkholz called Go the emerging language of cloud infrastructure and that is no accident Go was designed by people working at Google to make it easier to write Google relevant software in particular network resident servers That s what we call cloud today Some of the motivation for the design is in my Splash keynote from Go at Google Language Design in the Service of Software Engineering So although it was gratifying and important to see Docker Kubernetes and many other components of cloud computing written in Go it s perhaps not too surprising Go has indeed become the language of cloud infrastructure Evrone What competition do you see for the Go programming language right now and in what area What is your opinion about Rust with its no garbage collection ideas and compile time guarantees Rob Rust is an intriguing language and I watch its development with interest Beyond that I offer no opinion as I said above Evrone Go has just reached 70k stars on GitHub How do you see different social activities like GitHub Reddit Twitter offline and online conferences webinars etc influence the language Are they important for the language s success or they just reflect it Rob The people we have met through conferences and social media have been a critical part of the development of Go and all its elements Many many contributors have affected the development in positive ways including the original port to Windows and a number of non x86 architectures development of tools and libraries thoughtful discussions of technical proposals and much more And it goes the other way as the Go team reaches out to the community to start discussions pose questions and ask for help and guidance One thing that I think is important is to engage with the community as one voice to speak as a team rather than as individuals A consistent message is more easily understood Evrone How being the author of one of the popular programming languages has changed your life Rob A correction I am a co author not the author Ken Thompson and Robert Griesemer started the project with me and many others contributed massively So please don t single me out as the author To answer your question Go has certainly raised my public profile and introduced me to a new and vibrant community but beyond that it hasn t had much effect I ve had a long career with other successes and innumerable failures Evrone Imagine that you have an opportunity to travel back in time and give only one piece of advice to your younger self at around the time you\u2019ve started to design the Go language spec What advice would you give to yourself and your colleagues Rob That s easy Ignore the haters Just listen to the voices that understand and share your goals they re the ones to care about Not everyone agrees with what you re doing and that s OK But those who engage in advancing what you re trying to do can be a fantastic source of ideas energy and inspiration We will always be thankful to our passionate community At Evrone we pride ourselves on using the best tool for the job whether that\u2019s Ruby on Rails Python Elixir or of course Go We strive to stay at the forefront of a range of technologies to be able to provide the best and most appropriate solutions to meet our clients\u2019 needs and we\u2019re very happy to do all we can to help bring developer communities together", "page_url": "https://evrone.com/rob-pike-interview", "label": 1, "score":

436th Airlift Wing Using the camera audio devices and editing tools is something that I am new to and enjoying learning more about We are currently taking as much feedback as possible while trying to provide the best videos so that others can still continue their services or spiritual guidance online The Catholic and Protestant services air Sundays at a m and a m respectively on the Dover chapel s Facebook page This is the way we have adjusted for the COVID environment said Air Force Chaplain Capt Andre Davis Nobody else is here except for us when we are recording it We can watch it as a party with others and the chaplains can interact with individuals during the live time The services are available any time after the premiere on the Chapel s Facebook page A Thought of the Day video on spiritual resilience ethics or morality is also posted every day at a m We have been gaining some great momentum in our online services and intend to see how we can integrate this into normal operations moving forward Davis said Adhering to the implemented health protection measures chaplains along with the base s first sergeants also began weekly visits to airmen in the dorms We meet with the first sergeants of the squadrons we are assigned to and they have a roster with all the airmen s names on it said Air Force Chaplain Capt Jonathan Dawson After viewing the roster the first sergeant and I will go room by room and knock on their doors When the airman answers the door we make sure to keep our social distance while wearing our masks and ask how they are doing and if there is anything that we could do for them Dawson said he offers airmen his cell phone number in case they ever need guidance or someone to talk to He reassures them that he is only a text or call away While the chaplains are doing their best to reach out to all members on base they are also making squadron visits delivering food snacks and offering a friendly face or ear to those in need Chaplain Capt Ryan Taylor Byers and I just went and purchased a couple hundred dollars worth of snacks and food Dawson said We then went and delivered the snacks to the squadrons and airmen were glad to help us bring it in In about two or three weeks we will go and replenish the food and snacks Every week chaplains text or call leaders to see how they are doing giving them updates on airmen and seeing if there is anything else they may need We want everyone to know that the chaplains are still available if anyone needs to talk Davis said We ensure confidentiality and will take the appropriate steps to

conditions that may arise when caring for fallen service members and their families While a large portion of the nation is practicing social distancing and staying home the mortuary mission doesn t stop and AFMAO members must adapt now more than ever AFMAO s top priority is balancing team safety with mission requirements said Air Force Col Brian Eddy the commander of AFMAO To the max extent possible we are teleworking as an organization the colonel said However we do have mission sets that require our personnel to come in and execute and if that s the case we practice physical distancing and wearing of appropriate personal protective equipment if distance can t be maintained and overall good social hygiene One example is the operations center that serves as AFMAO s focal point for casualty notifications Controllers coordinate and track the transportation of remains from the place of death to the final resting place They also work with liaisons from other service branches to ensure overall mission success In addition to the protective measures put in place AFMAO has implemented alternative ways to support family members who travel to attend dignified transfers that are in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s social distancing guidelines In an effort to ensure the safety and health of family members and the mortuary staff family travel to dignified transfers is done on a case by case basis during the national emergency We in conjunction with our sister services have implemented a screening process for families prior to their departure from their homes and upon arrival at Dover Eddy said Additionally we screen all those involved in the dignified transfer to ensure everyone is healthy ensuring the safety of everyone Some of the changes put in place require families who attend dignified transfers to practice social distancing and wear masks while in common areas of the Fisher House for Families of the Fallen where they stay while at Dover It can sometimes be difficult to avoid the typical ways you may show support to a grieving family member said Air Force Tech Sgt Michelle Johnson the noncommissioned officer in charge of the Fisher House for Families of the Fallen Some families need that physical interaction or display of affection in order to feel comfort Our mission will never change and we are committed to providing our families a warm home away from home atmosphere where they can focus on coping with the loss of their loved one Even with new guidelines in place Johnson emphasized that AFMAO is still committed to completing the mission to the highest standards Continuing to provide the care service and support for the families of our nation s fallen is paramount Johnson said We will do this with the precautions set in place and continue to keep our airmen as healthy as possible Changes to the dignified transfer process itself include the formation s distance and the carry team wearing masks Even with the changes the mission will continue Eddy assured The level of care has not and will not change he said Our mission to provide dignity honor and respect to our fallen is constant and we are all committed to ensuring we continue to meet our sacred charge and the standard set before this national emergency Joy Clifford a resource advisor with the readiness division said there are challenges daily but through it all one theme sticks out People are adopting a mindset of collaboration not frustration she said We ve become more aware of our environment and have had to adjust to how we do things on a daily basis People are adapting very quickly and we ll continue to honor our fallen and their family\u2019s needs It s pretty amazing to see us focused on that one promise Air

Future Unmanned Aircraft Systems is a signature effort within the Army\u2019s Future Vertical Lift Modernization priority The Program Executive Office for Aviation\u2019s Unmanned Aircraft Systems Project Office in collaboration with Army Futures Command is leading the capabilities assessment The \u201cDevil Brigade\u201d is the first U S Army Forces Command unit to demonstrate one of the four vertical take off and landing unmanned aircraft systems procured for the assessment Assigned the Arcturus UAV JUMP it is the largest of the selected systems weighing pounds with an foot wingspan Despite the size its reduced acoustic signature compared to the Shadow is appreciated by the entire crew \u201cWe\u2019re used to screaming at each other and having to use radios in order to communicate \u201d said Spc Christopher McCoy a crew chief assigned to 1st Engineer Battalion 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team \u201cYou can stand right next to this aircraft and not even raise your voice \u201d said McCoy According to Spc Nicholas Miller an unmanned aircraft systems operator also assigned to 1st Engineer Battalion the JUMP maintains the ability to launch and recover from a confined area with minimal ground support equipment \u201cCurrently we need a runway for launch and recovery of the Shadow With the VTOL system on the JUMP we don\u2019t need any of that we\u2019re working with half the equipment \u201d he said The extended endurance of the system allows multiple operators to take turns training on the payload at altitude while a second aircraft conducts repeated launches and recoveries to train operators and crew chiefs on critical modes of flight Over the next five months the Big Red One Soldiers will operate the system as a surrogate for their RQ Shadow performing similar tactical tasks for the BCT but with the added vertical take off and landing capability and control while on the move The assessment utilizes a crawl walk run mentality progressing through operator and collective training then culminating in brigade level field training exercises and a Combat Training Center rotation Under increasing COVID precautions it was uncertain whether the assessment would remain on schedule Maj Gen John Kolasheski commanding general of the 1st Infantry Division determined the assessment could continue with proper mitigations The Army is following CDC and DoD guidelines to combat the spread of COVID The four other FORSCOM units participating in the assessment are assigned the Martin V Bat Textron Aerosonde HQ L3 Harris FVR and a second Arcturus UAV JUMP are scheduled to begin in the coming months These assessment schedules are under regular re evaluation as COVID conditions change For updates throughout the FTUAS assessment

an on site pair programming session in my opinion Given the logistical hurdles that need to be overcome for this however led me to collate a list of interesting questions that should be asked at the end of a technical interview to get the most information regarding the job on offer The questions given are in no particular order and may also be woven into conversation depending upon the interview What does your technology stack look like This allows your to figure out how up to date the firm is with technology Up to date here is entirely your definition What does your architecture look like This is an important follow up to the above question and allows you to figure out how good the interviewer is at big picture analysis Interesting discussions may be had regarding certain pieces time permitting What does your development lifecycle look like and how is requirements engineering done It seems like everyone is doing agile development with bi weekly sprints but what is more interesting is how much face time do developers get with users and how much decision room do they have What does your testing QA process look like Beware of anyone not running CI infrastructure with an automated build process Automated end to end integration testing before feature merge is a sign of a good quality team Automated stress and infrastructure failover testing including db restoration are all signs of a top notch team What is your team structure like people people people including the CTO just you It s good to get a feel for how many people will you be interacting with on a daily basis What is your production infrastucture like How much control do developers have over it Automated production deployment from QA should really be standard Having access to production logs and anonymized production data is very useful Having production accounts and access to the application as a user is excellent How much support do you expect developers to do regarding hours and availability Do you have a dedicated support staff This is a really important question especially in bigger organizations such as banks where you might be required to be on call for applications that your team owns Why did you choose technology X Why not Y This is a great question to get into a discussion with your interviewer and get to know their opinion on tech topics if you can engage them What sort of software do you use Source control just walk out if they are not using any Issue tracking Analytics big plus if they have analytics tracking IDEs developer machines any other software that might be pertinent What kind of training do you offer employees Probably the only question you will find on a generic interview preparation page Note there exists a Joel Test to determine the quality of a software team and there is some overlap here but I choose to frame my questions more open ended to create a discussion space I wish you all the very best in your interviews and I hope that you found these useful I

at the front lines of the national COVID response bringing unique and agile expertise and rapidly deployable resources to the fight the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs said Thomas McCaffery told Pentagon reporters today that the Defense Department and its Military Health System have mobilized active and reserve components of doctors nurses and medical technicians to two ships and numerous expeditionary field hospitals around the country to support local health care systems McCaffery and other leaders of the Military Health System took reporters questions about the military medical sector being in the middle of the COVID battle For example some National Guard service members are offering frontline care to community based testing distributing personal protective equipment medical supplies food and water all part of the concerted national response to serve and support hard hit communities McCaffery said For the first time in its more than year history the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences \u2013 the military s own medical school \u2014 has graduated nurses and doctors early so they are on the front lines of the COVID response he noted The Military Health System also is heavily involved in better understanding the virus how to treat it and how to prevent it We are putting all the best brains in our military medical research facilities working in partnership with other federal agencies on future treatments and vaccines McCaffery said Our research experts are focusing in on diagnostic testing \u2026 using robust laboratory networks to perform testing and pursuing additional types of diagnostic capabilities to include serologic testing to assess the patients blood for the presence of COVID antibodies DOD also has invested million to research three vaccine candidates McCaffery said adding that the department is collaborating closely with other federal research efforts These medical research teams continue to be at the forefront in support of the whole of government response to this pandemic he added DOD is working hard to ensure its beneficiaries have continued access to the care they need by ramping up virtual health capabilities establishing drive up testing sites and putting the right protection measures in place to minimize exposure risk to patients and health care workers McCaffery emphasized The department has expanded its nurse advice telephone line to include over the phone screening tools to meet the surge witnessed just weeks ago he said noting that it now handles up to calls a day from people who need medical consultation To reach the advice line visit the MHS Nurse Advice Line website for web chat and video chat or dial TRICARE and choose option DOD s medical treatment facilities are putting in place pharmacy drive throughs and curbside delivery in some cases up to vehicles and patients a day McCaffery said demonstrating our ability to protect our people while also staying mission ready At the same time he continued we haven t let up supporting combat readiness for service members even while we ve surged laboratory and research facilities to support national and international events As it contends with a historic challenge for the nation McCaffery said the Military Health System is bringing all it has to bear in the fight from highly trained medical providers and a world class health care system to cutting edge research and development expertise in a wide ranging arsenal On military combat capabilities the system is trained to be agile and adaptable he said That s why we re here he added And that s what we do across the Military Health System That s what you see in action today The men and women serving in the military medical field are delivering today on the front lines of hospitals and clinics in the labs and behind scenes advancing the priorities of the department to protect the American people maintain national readiness and support the nation s needs he

General Hall says witnessing the transformation of the Javits Convention Center which hosted a car show just a few weeks earlier into a field hospital has been incredible A couple of weeks later and we\u2019ve got patients in this field hospital we\u2019ve got ICU beds and we\u2019re caring for patients in something that was a concrete floor only a few weeks ago People that did not know they were going to come together and execute this mission A true testament to the American spirit and a true testament to the professionalism of both our service members and DOD civilians and what they\u2019ve done Unbelievable Based on the current patient load Major General Hall says the field hospital at the Javits Center is currently the 10th largest in New York and larger than any Department of Defense hospital currently operating It\u2019s absolutely amazing to see what our service men and women are doing because we\u2019ve got people from the Army the Navy Air Force and Marine Corps all running this operation Some of them had worked together before we got here but a lot of them had not The timeline to get them here and get them integrated has been very short and I\u2019ve just been very pleased with what folks are doing I would tell you the city of New York is very appreciative of that and the level of care they are providing Related USNS Comfort resilience on the front lines As he helps coordinate the response in the New York area Major General Hall says he s mindful of the sacrifices being made across the country \u201cWhen you see what New York is going through right now the epicenter for the United States \u2013 I know from my personal experience my two small children and my wife back at Fort Eustis and some of the challenges with them staying at home but the option of not staying at home is much worse than the pain that we are going to go through in the short term so it\u2019s definitely worth that New Yorkers have done a great job They are very resilient in what they are doing We are going to come out of this on the backside in a better place we just have to work through the coming weeks In addition to those on the ground Major General Hall says about of his staff is still in Newport News providing important forward support to the mission Click here for full coronavirus", "page_url":

workshops and groups of clearly military vehicles waiting in the fenced in yards outside The names associated with the facility include White s Paint and Glass as well as HD Logit Various workers toil on different tasks mostly centered around refurbishing and preserving these military vehicles That is what is done here said Wesley Ernest a paint expert at the facility We can refurbish anything We ve done it to HEMTTs most of the vehicles currently there in various configurations engines engine containers close to a dozen different trailer types HEMTT stands for Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck It is a modular vehicle and can be configured in many ways for many purposes An engine container as Ernest explains is a container designed as the name says to contain and protect and engine

even big rig concrete trucks We ve worked with tracked vehicles including specialty Army gear that is only used in Alaska In addition the shop works with armor on vehicles plating as well as whole kits which is where the armored glass comes in Jeff Ford a technician in the shop as well as a Liberty Eylau volunteer firefighter comes from an Army family and he has been around these kinds of vehicles all his life Some of these old warhorses have pretty colorful history he said We get a little of everything here and crews have in some cases been shot or blown up in them It is kind of an honor to be able to work on vehicles with this kind of history to have a chance to put them back together and to imagine what it is like where they are going next considering most of our current crop

military deputy of the Robotics Requirements Division at MCDID told Military com \u201cGD did a really good job with their system \u201d GDLS will make some changes to the system however before it is fielded he said describing how the generator will be moved to reduce noise \u201cIt is all electric but there is a generator that charges the battery so that generator was sitting on the outside of the vehicle and it was loud \u201d Brown said \u201cThey are going to take that generator put it under the deck and soundproof it so it s a lot less noisy \u201d The SMET will be capable of hauling more than pounds of soldier gear at a speed of about eight miles per hour \u201cIt s generally supposed to go at walking speed with the squad that s why it s eight miles per hour \u201d Brown said The SMET will also generate three kilowatts of power to charge the growing number of tactical electronic devices soldiers carry \u201cHaving that power generation forward with multiple battery chargers was really important to the soldiers \u201d Brown said The Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport SMET U S Army photo On the current contract the Army plans to buy SMETs and begin fielding them to IBCTs between the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal he added Initially the SMET was intended to go to every squad but Army officials decided that such a small unit doesn t have

fixed wing and rotary drones at a government owned training range at Fort Sill Oklahoma the company said in a news release Thursday It marked the first time the service operated the system instead of Lockheed engineers tracking targets with a military owned command and control C2 system The radar track was provided to airmen who operated ATHENA via cues from the C2 then ATHENA s beam director

previous experiments by the Army in and The fiber laser equipped with advanced beam control technology took out five Outlaw drones at the Army s White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico in The Air Force focus is to field test and evaluate directed energy systems for counter drone capability and readiness for fielding for air base defense mission Lockheed spokesman Mark Lewis told Military com on Thursday Meanwhile the Army s focus has been to determine what capabilities directed energy and C2 will facilitate the defeat of aerial threats for the maneuver brigade and maneuver battalion he said That includes defense against mortar attacks Other defense companies are also making headway In August the Air Force awarded Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems a million contract for two prototype high energy laser weapons HELW systems designed to take out unmanned aerial systems The service expects to deploy the HELW mounted on ground based vehicles in a few months for a year long test The Air Force also gave Raytheon a million contract to prototype the Phaser high powered microwave counter drone system to be deployed and tested by service personnel within the same timeframe as the HELW The latest news highlights the military s need to address the growing challenge of targeting small unsophisticated but potentially lethal drones For example in September swarms of drones decimated Saudi oil production facilities which prompted the U S to increase its posture in the region A new report published earlier this year states that emerging counter drone technologies both for

grenade launchers to spy on enemy activity downrange Once fired from an M320A1 40mm grenade launcher soldiers can control the Grenade Launched Unmanned Aerial System GLUAS with a handheld device and receive video feed from the drone s onboard camera John Gerdes a mechanical engineer with Army Research Lab ARL said in a recent Army news release In battle there are multiple scenarios of when soldiers would use this technology Gerdes said Basically if there is something you want to look at but you have no idea where it is yet that s where the drone comes in Last year the Army began fielding pocket sized helicopter drones to units under the Soldier Borne Sensor SBS Program They are capable of flying up to minutes while transmitting live video and still images from up to two kilometers away Related Army Fields Tiny Pocket Drones to Paratroopers at Fort Bragg The GLUAS has two variants One is a small paragliding system with folding blade propellers and Mylar paragliding wings to help it stay in the air according to the release The other variant is a helicopter style that hovers on a gimbaling set of coaxial rotors The grenade launched drone has a two kilometer range with a projected battery life that could top minutes and is capable of operating up to feet in the air the release states This device provides an autonomy and intelligence platform to help soldiers perform useful missions while having a lookout from hundreds of feet in the air Gerdes said Things like GPS receivers and flight controllers are very feasible to install onto the GLUAS which makes it easy to maintain a position or follow a ground unit The Army first began fielding the M320 grenade launcher in and later upgraded to the M320A1 The system has a meter maximum effective range for an area target The Marine Corps recently fielded its new M320A1 grenade launcher to Marines at Camp Lejeune North Carolina and intends to field it to all of its infantry units by fiscal The ARL serves as the Army s corporate research laboratory under the service s Combat Capabilities Development Command We re here to develop innovative concepts for the warfighter s needs which generally means we bring

it requires the 412th Test Wing s flight test squadrons at Edwards Air Force Base California are working through the challenges to accomplish their missions The 452nd Flight Test Squadron has worked through the challenges of teleworking and modified work schedules to keep its fleet of RQ Global Hawks flying and meeting mission requirements The 452nd is also the combined test force for the Global Vigilance combined task force said Air Force Maj Marc Nichols 452nd FLTS assistant director of operations Here we re involved with testing systems and avionics upgrades he added We also engage in foreign military sales testing we hope to deliver an aircraft to South Korea this week The Global Hawk is a remotely piloted high altitude long endurance aircraft With a wingspan of more than feet the aircraft is able to attain a flight ceiling of feet Its main mission is to provide intelligence communications surveillance and reconnaissance using a multitude of sensors to combatant commands worldwide Nichols said The COVID pandemic meant that the 452nd FLTS had to devise plans to ensure team members were as safe as possible yet still be able to complete their test missions The 452nd s unique mission allows the unit to execute missions with personnel being separate from each other noted EmmaLee Shenberger a test conductor and operations engineer with the 452nd FLTS The mission setup for the Global Hawk is unique in the sense that the 452nd has the ability to execute missions in a modular fashion Shenberger explained At the 452nd we are already accustomed to executing missions in an isolated arrangement simply because the mission personnel are not all collocated during a Global Hawk flight With this capability the 452nd is able to execute missions with all required flight personnel participating while also maintaining the appropriate separation deemed mandatory during this pandemic The Global Hawk combined task force team understands the importance to keep their missions going and showed no hesitation when it came time to be flexible and adapt to recent changes Shenberger added By hustling our personnel and preparing them for teleworking our squadron stayed competitive she said We were and are still prepared for what could happen next while also continuing our contribution and work for the warfighter Although with this transition there have been few growing pains she continued we are patient with each other we have kept faith and work to communicate with each other to the best of our abilities and we trust each other We have trust in each other knowing that we all share the same objective and that is to support the warfighter Despite the challenges the team has been able to execute its missions ensuring that the warfighter and allied nations are able to use systems and equipment such as the Global Hawk It s definitely been a challenge Nichols said We were poised to start executing with as much telework as possible when we first realized it was becoming a threat to the Southern California area We moved people into a telework posture but we re able to maintain our mission set so we were able to launch this Global Hawk aircraft last week and complete the testing that was required before we were going to send it back to Beale Air Force Base During that time the team also was able to complete testing on a separate program that is under engineering review We were all ready to proceed with what needed to happen in order to keep as few people in the office and as much social distancing as required while at the same time executing the missions with as much mitigation as possible Nichols said Other safety measures included sanitation procedures between pilots and sensor operators when handing off control of the aircraft at the Mission Control Element Nichols said that Edwards Air Force Base leaders have been outstanding in terms of being able to help the squadron accomplish its mission while keeping their people safe They said people are the priority she said Test is still very important obviously but all the way down from Air Force Materiel Command and Air Force Test Center level leadership to the wing and down to the squadron commanders they ve given the commanders leeway to make their decisions with the posture of Keep everybody safe but keep getting the mission done The adversaries are out there \u2014 it s not just the virus but people are going to be watching to see how the 412th Test Wing executes in the midst of all this I think we ll have them on their back foot It makes us feel good she continued It s nice that we re able to keep on doing the mission COVID is a complex situation that we re all trying to deal with and I m just happy knowing that our adversaries know that we re still out there

Military Mobility The task force co chaired by former Supreme Allied Commander Europe General Curtis Scaparrotti USA Ret and former US Ambassador to Hungary Colleen Bell will officially launch the report on April during a public event with senior US NATO and EU military and defense officials and experts The report\u2019s findings come at a time when the military mobility effort in Europe has lost momentum in the face of other economic and political pressures and requires renewed emphasis at every level to succeed The Atlantic Council\u2019s task force on military mobility comprised of former and current senior US and European defense officials and experts was established in April to assess the adequacy of military mobility enhancement efforts in Europe to support the rapid reinforcement of allied forces across the continent in the event of crisis or war Through a year long study drawing on consultations with NATO the EU and national government officials the task force developed a set of concrete recommendations which together represent a critical next step to enhancing NATO\u2019s twenty first century conventional deterrence posture and military mobility throughout Europe \u201cThe Transatlantic security environment is dynamic and increasingly challenging Focused and consistent investment in military mobility over the coming years is required to establish robust

\u201d Ambassador Colleen Bell former US ambassador to Hungary philanthropist and strong proponent of a coherent and comprehensive approach to military mobility in Europe said \u201cEnsuring NATO has the capabilities to deter and if necessary defeat any adversary is vital It is just as important to ensure Allies can project those capabilities where they are needed when they are needed Eliminating barriers to freedom of military movement is critical to NATO meeting the full spectrum of current and emerging security challenges \u201d As the director of the task force Wayne Schroeder a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council has led an extensive program of research on ongoing military mobility efforts and the remaining gaps and barriers \u201cA true transatlantic commitment and a whole of government approach by the nations of Europe to military mobility will be central to assuring peace freedom and security across the continent in the 21st century \u201d said Schroeder \u201cWhile Europe currently finds itself in a challenging fiscal environment it has the resource base to provide the robust and stable funding needed to ensure the success of the project

traditional missions like providing warning and supporting warfighters intelligence agencies now provide assessments on transnational crime the environment and global health They monitor great powers regional powers and non state actors They track day to day events and offer long term estimates And they receive an increasing share of the federal budget last year the combined national and military intelligence budgets topped billion All of this points to a need for stronger oversight Recent events however point in the opposite direction In early April President Donald Trump fired Michael Atkinson the inspector general of the intelligence community The president was not shy about his reasons For months he has publicly questioned Atkinson\u2019s integrity and privately complained about his perfidy The source of Trump\u2019s anger was Atkinson\u2019s role in shepherding an anonymous whistleblower\u2019s complaint that the president had enlisted the president of Ukraine to deliver dirt on Joe Biden Upon receiving the complaint the inspector general launched an investigation and determined that it was credible At that point he forwarded the complaint to the acting director of national intelligence setting in motion a chain of events that led to Trump\u2019s impeachment Trump reportedly took this as proof that Atkinson was disloyal an unforgivable sin in this administration It is not however substantive grounds for dismissal House Republicans began an investigation into Atkinson\u2019s handling of the whistleblower complaint in January but so far they have not turned up anything improper nor anything that would rise to the level of a firing offense Multiple witnesses confirmed the account during Trump\u2019s impeachment hearing as did the White House\u2019s call records of Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukraine\u2019s president last summer Exacting revenge on government officials for doing their jobs is bad Going after inspectors general is especially dangerous because they serve as watchdogs for Congress and the public Going after the intelligence community inspector general is worst of all due to the uneasy place of secret intelligence in a democracy Intelligence agencies rely on secrecy to do their work but a democracy requires transparency in order to hold them accountable and to ensure that agencies execute policy direction faithfully without exceeding their mandate or abusing their privileges Inspectors general are vital They serve a \u201c boundary spanning \u201d function acting simultaneously as internal and external watchdogs An inspector general is part of the hierarchy of its respective agency but its activities are not subject to internal sanction By law inspectors general have broad access to organizational practices even when organizations operate behind multiple layers of classification Beginning with the Inspectors General Act of Congress has steadily expanded their powers Most recently the Inspector General Empowerment Act of ensures that they have \u201chave timely access to all records reports audits reviews documents papers recommendations or other materials available \u201d If inspectors general span the boundary between internal and external oversight they also straddle the barbed wire fence between Congress and the White House They are the vehicles of oversight from both directions helping to mediate between executive interests in policy execution and Congressional demands for accountability This is akin to what Uri Bar Joseph called multilateral control which has proven to be a useful safeguard against intelligence intervention in democratic societies Inspectors general have uncovered and corrected intelligence abuses in the past During the height of the Vietnam War for example Presidents Johnson and Nixon both authorized a CIA program that sought to discover foreign agitators working within the antiwar movement Under the auspices of Operation Chaos as it became known in the CIA ultimately opened files on thousands of American citizens including members of Congress CIA officers also infiltrated protest groups and cultivated internal sources They found no evidence that foreign states were sponsoring or organizing the movement however and by the early 1970s some officers expressed concern that the program exceeded the agency\u2019s foreign espionage mandate Their frustration went nowhere until the fall of when CIA Inspector General William V Broe sent a warning letter to the executive director William Colby Director of Central Intelligence Richard Helms then instigated a formal review of the program According to intelligence historian John Prados Broe\u2019s intervention \u201cmarked the beginning of CIA\u2019s shift away from domestic surveillance \u201d Importantly Broe\u2019s warning came not as the result of a specific review of Operation Chaos but as a by product of a normal audit Members of the inspector general team conducting a periodic review of the Directorate of Operations discovered signs that domestic surveillance had become \u201cindiscriminate \u201d In the words of one member of the inspector general\u2019s staff the review turned up \u201cbroader concerns on the part of personnel in the field as to whether the agency was being made part of some thought police program \u201d The effort would have probably been impossible without having a staff in place that had the ability to speak candidly with officers throughout the CIA The Department of Justice review of FBI procedures during the investigation of associates of the Trump campaign in provides a more recent example Inspector General Michael Horowitz\u2019s report uncovered serious problems in how the Bureau handled information that was used in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act FISA applications A subsequent inspector general report found that errors in FBI procedures were not just related to the investigation of the Trump campaign\u2019s alleged ties to Russia The inspector general office reviewed FISA applications going back to and found \u201ca deficiency in the FBI\u2019s efforts to support the factual statements in FISA applications\u2026 that undermines the FBI\u2019s ability to achieve its \u2018scrupulously accurate\u2019 standard for FISA applications \u201d These are damning findings as even defenders of the FBI acknowledged Horowitz was granted a level of deference as inspector general His conclusions were impossible to ignore These episodes underscore the value of an independent inspector general Controversial programs were able to survive until the inspectors general stepped in Operation Chaos survived an audit from the White House Office of Management and Budget but it could not survive the attention of the inspector general staff Similarly FBI errors continued for years \u2014 despite repeated warnings from civil libertarians about flaws in the FISA process \u2014 until the inspector general began to scrutinize the program in earnest Congress has traditionally sought to protect inspectors general and it has pushed back against presidential attempts to replace them Upon taking office President Reagan tried to fire all of the inspectors general appointed by President Carter Senate outrage followed leading Reagan to reinstate five of them and setting the precedent that the inspectors general would not be expected to resign at the end of any given administration Executive action has been infrequent since that time and rare exceptions have drawn bipartisan criticism The intelligence community has been spared entirely Congressional protection has been enough to safeguard inspectors general from political pressure for more than years About half of the corps of inspectors general are appointees serving at the pleasure of the president but past leaders have been reluctant to dismiss them After Trump\u2019s election in members of his transition team reportedly warned some inspectors general that they would be removed only to reverse course later Trump\u2019s action against Atkinson however indicates that he is not bound by tradition or deterred by Congress Upset at Trump\u2019s decision some senators are demanding a detailed explanation from the White House They should go further Insulating inspectors general from presidential pressure is necessary because of three converging trends that threaten the delicate balance between secrecy and democracy The first is eroding \u201cnorms of mutual toleration and institutional forbearance \u201d Government works best when institutional actors recognize the value of adhering to expected behaviors Parties compete for votes and bureaucracies struggle for wealth and autonomy but they view each other as legitimate rivals and play within a set of spoken and unspoken rules Intense partisanship and political tribalism are putting those assumptions under strain This exacerbates the second trend declining public trust in government stretching back to the 1960s Faith in institutions is important for efficient administration Courts have long granted the presumption of regularity or the belief that government officials are working in good faith This belief may sound na\u00efve but it encourages institutions to operate without crippling under the weight of perfectionism In this sense it is a useful fiction even if we know that there is misconduct in government we assume most of the time that there isn\u2019t so that institutions can go about their business But this will become increasingly untenable as public trust in government dwindles and there are already signs that the courts are unwilling to grant the presumption of regularity to the Trump administration The intelligence community has been relatively immune to declining public trust in government An NPR PBS Marist College poll in summer for instance showed that percent of respondents had \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca good amount\u201d of trust in the intelligence community This is a great deal higher than Congress percent or the Trump administration percent And while there is some partisanship at work here \u2014 Democrats have undoubtedly become more favorable towards intelligence because of the Russia controversy \u2014 this level of support is not new Historical data shows that a majority of Americans have held a favorable opinion of intelligence at least since the 1980s Other research shows continued support for the intelligence community even as the public becomes more skeptical in general Past results do not guarantee future performance of course and opinions may sour The transparency movement that began after the Cold War \u2014 the third converging trend \u2014 has led intelligence to play an increasingly public role in policy debates It has also put the intelligence community in a precarious position Policymakers are tempted to politicize intelligence when the public expects that estimates on current issues will be declassified The more that intelligence agencies are tied to certain policies and certain policymakers the more that they will be roped into intense partisan fights This will make it more difficult to sustain broad support Stronger inspectors general can help to buffer the intelligence community from all three of these trends Insulating them from political pressure will go some distance to restoring the norm that career officials are subject to legal and procedural rules not to the whims of any given leader In so doing they can also restore public trust that intelligence agencies are operating under effective oversight and are not free to improvise in ways that exceed their mandate If the inspectors general succeed intelligence agencies can exploit the blessings of secrecy without undermining the democratic demand for accountability For all these reasons Congress should review existing protections for inspectors general in the intelligence community and perhaps consider some new ones It might for example revisit Sen Susan Collins\u2019 proposal for fixed terms as a way of removing the presidential temptation to purge the ranks Such changes will not solve the immediate crisis but they might help to rebuild confidence when new leaders come into office Joshua Rovner is associate professor in the School of International Service at American University In and he was

different F and haul it to the \u201cwash rack\u201d for perhaps the last thorough cleaning it will ever get Meanwhile about a mile away a small army of specialty painters fans out across a dirt lot to spray protective coating on row after row of mothballed C transport planes Welcome to a typical Thursday morning at the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group Tucson s most famous square mile parking lot with roughly billion worth of military might The people who work here generally refer to the place by its acronym or \u201cA marg\u201d as they call it Most everyone else \u2014 here and around the globe \u2014 knows it as the airplane graveyard or simply the boneyard But that nickname only tells part of the story Though the boneyard is the final destination for most of the warplanes that end up there some do return to the sky In May AMARG restored a B bomber to active duty after more than a decade in storage Now workers at the facility are preparing dozens of retired F fighter jets to fly again this time as full sized \u201cdrone\u201d aerial targets piloted by remote control They also help get surplus military machines ready for delivery to U S allies like the six helicopters that were sent to Greece earlier this year and the five more that will soon be sold to Israel \u201cAny day that you come here there s a really wide variety of things we could be working on \u201d says Air Force Col Jennifer Barnard now in her third year as group commander \u201cWhen somebody says Oh is this happening at A marg Yeah probably \u201d The sum of its parts Arguably the boneyard s most important mission is to serve as a giant open air parts warehouse for the U S military and others During the past fiscal year alone AMARG \u201creclaimed\u201d different parts from the aircraft in its collection saving taxpayers an estimated million in replacement costs And as the only facility of its kind in the nation the boneyard is often the only place left to find the parts needed for certain types of older aircraft Barnard says simple high priority orders can be filled the same day but larger hard to reach parts can take weeks or months to harvest and deliver \u201cWe ve done special cuts on aircraft where we ll cut a piece of an airplane and send it to somebody who needs it \u201d she says One of the C 130s that services the science stations in Antarctica sports a tail section that once soaked up the sun in Tucson \u201cThat s kind of why we get looked at as an air power reservoir \u201d Barnard says \u201cOur guys take a lot of pride in preserving these aircraft and taking really good care of them They know they might be needed again whether it s a whole airplane or just its parts \u201d A visit to the \u201cflush farm\u201d Roughly of aircraft arrive at the boneyard under their own power They land at Davis Monthan Air Force Base and taxi through a gate at the southeastern end of the runway to be prepped for slumber Their first stop is the \u201cflush farm \u201d where defueling supervisor Dale Pace and his crew can service up to six aircraft a day depending on the type Pace says the task takes longer for large airplanes with multiple engines like the massive C Galaxy transport \u201cThat takes us forever and a day to defuel \u201d the former Air Force mechanic says It works a little like a blood transfusion All of the aviation fuel is pumped out and replaced with a special oil similar to the stuff used in sewing machines that coats the tanks and fuel systems to protect them from corrosion The only way to do that is by firing up the engines On this recent Thursday the crew is working on the Navy P which arrived at AMARG the week before and was towed to the flush farm earlier in the morning Two members of Pace s team climb behind the controls of the retro looking airplane and spin up all four props to burn off the last of the jet fuel and draw the oil into all the places that need protecting Pace stands outside the aircraft watching the engines for the telltale sign that the exchange is complete As soon as he sees puffs of white smoke like at the Vatican he motions to the men in the cockpit to cut the power To coat all the necessary engine parts in an F or an F the fighter jets have to be lashed to the ground and run with their afterburners on creating a rumbling sound that echoes across Tucson \u201cAnd if you do it in the winter you get a nice long flame\u201d from the exhaust ports says storage induction supervisor Herman Castillo Any airplanes that are expected to fly again one day must be brought out of storage once every four years to be refueled and fired back up to make sure their engines and other systems are still in working order Then they are flushed again sealed back up and returned to the boneyard Castillo says Durand Silva an aircraft maintainer with the Civil Service scrubs down the nose of a Lockheed C being prepared to be sent off from Davis Monthan Air Force base aircraft boneyard to a new customer through the regeneration initiative on Oct The dirty job of getting clean The next stop is the wash rack where men in protective rain gear give a Coast Guard C transport plane a nose to tail scrubbing before it flies off to be outfitted to fight wildfires The aircraft has already been painted with the U S Forest Service name and logo Nearby other members of the six man crew use high pressure sprayers and industrial degreaser to clean A wings and landing gear pods recently \u201cbrought in from the desert \u201d The parts will be refurbished in a shop at AMARG and used to extend the life of the Air Force s fleet of ground attack jets a mainstay at Davis Monthan and in the skies above Tucson Wash rack supervisor Mike Sherry says that on average his crew cleans about four airplanes and refurbished parts each week The men bake all summer in their rubber suits then spend the cold winter outside soaking wet \u201cIt s miserable work \u201d Sherry says \u201cIt s one of the hardest jobs at AMARG \u201d It s also an important one Cleaning the aircraft and their components makes them more resistant to decay Sherry says \u201cI m kind of a jerk I ll go behind my guys with a white glove \u201d he says with a grin \u201cThese aircraft need to survive out in the desert for a long time \u201d The hangar where a six man crew uses sprayers and degreaser to clean A wings and landing gear pods The parts will be refurbished and used to extend the life of other aircraft Serving the armed services since The boneyard was established in to store World War II bombers and transports Tucson was chosen for its dry desert air \u2014 perfect for preventing corrosion \u2014 and hard caliche soil capable of supporting heavy airplanes without the need for thousands of acres of concrete It became the nation s primary storage center for military aircraft in when about a thousand Navy planes were transferred to the site from a depot near Phoenix The facility s inventory hit an all time high of aircraft in as the Vietnam War was winding down Today AMARG is home to about aircraft of different varieties from small helicopters to some of the world s largest military cargo planes As Pace the flush farm supervisor puts it \u201cEverything for everyone ends up out here \u201d Each branch of the military is represented as are the Coast Guard Border Patrol FBI Forest Service NASA the National Science Foundation and several allied governments Barnard considers all those agencies and armed forces her customers They have the final say over how their airplanes are stored and used \u201cWe don t own anything here \u201d the commander explains \u201cWe re like giant property managers We take care of these things but we don t own any of it \u201d Lots of veterans not much saluting The atmosphere at AMARG is businesslike but decidedly unstarched Roughly people work at the boneyard and almost none of them are required to salute anybody Barnard is one of only three active duty Air Force personnel assigned to the operation The rest are civilian Defense Department employees and government contractors Barnard is still the boss but she has to work a little harder at it \u201cI actually have a personal philosophy that if you lead civilians if they choose to follow you you re that much more effective of a leader Because they have a choice right \u201d she says with a smile A lot of the employees have military backgrounds and many of them served as aircraft mechanics Before he ended up as AMARG s wash rack supervisor Sherry used to maintain fighter jets at Luke Air Force Base in Phoenix among other places He says a few of the F 16s he worked on when he was in the Air Force have since showed up at the boneyard including one or two problem birds he wasn t too happy to see again Some aircraft show up with personal notes written on them by the last people to fly them Sherry points to the F that was just brought to his crew for a wash There on the nose cone a pilot with the call sign \u201cDude Bro\u201d has left his goodbye in black Sharpie \u201cThank you for your service ol girl \u201d Sherry says AMARG occasionally invites pilots out to watch when one of their old airplanes is ready to be retired for good once all the usable parts have been harvested and the thing is about to be cut up and crushed into little pieces \u201cWe try to find the pilots who had the last flight on them To watch them get choked up it s heart wrenching \u201d he says Disarmed for the trip to the \u201cdesert\u201d Dean Clark and Gary Chartier play a crucial role at the boneyard They re the ones who make sure no one gets blown up or launched into the sky while working on one of the mothballed warplanes Today they are disarming the ejection system on an F Standing at the top of some rolling metal stairs Clark reads the steps off a checklist as Chartier leans down into the cockpit to disconnect and remove the explosive charges Clark says the process usually takes three to four hours depending on the age of the aircraft Older F 18s are the worst he says \u201cThere s a bunch of springs and wires It s annoying \u201d This is the last step in the \u201cinduction\u201d process before an airplane gets towed out to what boneyard workers call \u201cthe desert \u201d though it isn t a desert at all The storage area actually sits on roughly acres of hard packed dirt dotted with weeds crabgrass and anthills There the airplanes are parked in neat rows and loosely grouped based on their status which can range from ready to fly to soon to be scrapped Generally speaking \u201canything that s east of Kolb Road it will never fly again \u201d says Leo Bernier a storage services work leader A boneyard with creature comforts The far east end of the property is also where AMARG stores about pieces of aircraft production tooling just in case a defense contractor wants to fire up its factory again and start churning out new airplanes or parts For now the stacks of tools and rows of wooden crates mostly provide shelter for pack rats rattlesnakes and the occasional swarm of bees AMARG spokeswoman Terry Pittman says occasional wildlife encounters are just part of the job Javelina regularly find their way onto the installation including one that stole a boot that belonged to a member of the wash crew Not long ago a mule deer got into the boneyard and lived there for about a month before state game wardens were called in to tranquilize the animal and move it off the base \u201cJust last week we found a ringtail cat inside a soda machine \u201d Pittman says \u201cI don t know if it was trying to get warm or cold \u201d A baby ringtail rescued from a mothballed bomber back in the 1950s went on to become one of the Arizona Sonora Desert Museum s earliest animal ambassadors Anything in the boneyard that still has wings \u2014 unless it s an actual quail or owl \u2014 quickly gets lashed down with cables \u201cAirplanes by nature like to fly so when the wind blows you want them to stay on the ground \u201d Barnard says \u201cWe have a securing plan for every aircraft that describes how many of those tie downs it needs The most extensive one is the C which has tie downs \u201d Saving taxpayers dollars The final step in the storage process belongs to what everyone still calls the \u201cSpraylat crew \u201d even though the boneyard doesn t use that particular brand of spray on latex coating anymore Using a \u201csealing diagram\u201d supplied by the owner of the aircraft the painting crew will cover every window access panel seam and opening with easy to peel paint and a reflective thermal coating to help keep the inside of the aircraft cool while protecting the machine from the elements The workers start the way any house painter might \u2014 by marking off parts of the aircraft with a special type of painter s tape that pulls off easily without damaging the vehicle s finish or leaving behind any sticky residue Then they spray on two to three coats of black latex paint followed by two coats of white vinyl similar to the flexible coating found on the flat roofs of many Tucson homes It s \u201cnot really rocket science \u201d but it is exacting says Bernier who leads one of the painting crews Each coat is measured down to the millimeter to make sure it is thick enough to do the job but can easily be peeled off later if necessary They usually work in pairs but some \u201cbig birds\u201d require a four man team Coating a C requires roughly square feet of sealant that can take five to six days to apply Your standard fighter jet usually takes four to five days Certain helicopters have to be completely cocooned which can eat up a full week The largest aircraft in the boneyard the giant C also requires seven days of taping and spraying but it used to be a whole lot worse Bernier says the original sealing diagram for the massive transport required protective coating along the leading edge of every wing including the one atop the tail more than six stories above the ground He says his crew would be lucky to finish a job like that in under two weeks The coating is designed to last five years so Bernier and company have to reapply it to some of the aircraft that are stored for longer than that This is the most visible part of the operation the part of AMARG the general public probably recognizes from looking at aerial photos or driving past the base To some people all those idle but expensive airplanes represents an enormous waste \u2014 acres upon acres of needless military expenditures collecting dust in the desert sun But Bernier sees the boneyard like a bank account Every part of every aircraft they can save and pull back out later is one less part that needs to be bought or built somewhere else \u201cWe re saving billions of taxpayers dollars \u201d Bernier says as he stands in the shadow of a C in the middle of its paint job \u201cThat s what it comes down to \u201d \u00a9 The Arizona Daily Star Tucson Ariz \u2013 Distributed by Tribune Content Agency LLC", "page_url":

Soldiers in Trouble, Army Warns", "text": "Tactical gear companies love when combat troops are seen using their newest products but soldiers who accept free knives snivel gear and the latest gadgets are likely violating Army policy It happens all the time in the exhibit halls of defense conferences Firms pass out free gear samples known as schwag to soldiers and other service members in uniform Many other companies and organizations like to give troops goods and services as a reward for serving their country But in general soldiers are prohibited from accepting gifts given because of their status as a soldier according to recently released Army guidance Military com talked to John Kent who is an expert in ethics as the associate deputy general counsel at the Army Office of General Counsel about the confusing maze of do s and don ts for accepting gifts In most cases soldiers are not allowed to accept gifts of more than in value from what s known as a prohibited source such as a Defense Department contractor Kent said It could be everything from an invitation to a gala or a ball it could be someone offering an individual a watch or tickets to a ball game or it could be an upgraded flight he said explaining that in many cases soldiers accept items without realizing they are violating Army policy Related Soldiers GoFundMe Campaigns May Get Them in Legal Trouble Army Warns That s why we are constantly trying to train folks to go over the rules every year because they are not always intuitive People might not understand Kent said A guy like me I am an ethics attorney and one of our missions every year is we train people on the rules to make sure they know what they can and can t do While military ethics and conflict of interest rules are governed by a Defense Department instruction each military service provides its own guidance to the force about acceptable and prohibited activities What surprises many is how many firms are considered DoD contractors Kent said describing the list published by the DoD Standards of Conduct Office of companies that hold at least in Pentagon contracts It s surprising you ve got everyone from the Walt Disney Company to of course Boeing and Lockheed to all sorts of universities Most universities are DoD contractors Kent said The list is huge There are thousands of names on it If their name is on that list and they are a defense contractor they are a prohibited source And the rules for gifts also apply to spouses and other family members he said Gifts given to a soldier s spouse or family member are also subject to the rules and can therefore be problematic Kent said adding that the rule covers family members in the service member s household such as parents siblings children and dependent relatives The key part is the concern that the gift may have been given to that family member or someone who lives with the soldier because of the soldier s status he explained It s rare that the soldier would face disciplinary action but it could happen Kent said We would rather just tell the soldier \u2018we are sorry you are going to have to return this \u2019 he added Food snacks and coffee are often a gray area and can be accepted in many cases If you go to a DoD contractor s plant to visit and talk business and they set out doughnuts bagels and coffee or soft drinks we are allowed to accept those And the reason is they are not considered a gift Kent said Units serving in certain geographic areas such as combat zones are often granted exceptions for receiving care packages from companies he added So if a contractor a prohibited source were to make available food stuffs bags of Starbucks coffee or whatnot and just put them out on a table where anybody at a particular base or outpost in a geographic area say Iraq and anybody that comes along could take some of those take samples that could be an exclusion depending on all the facts where we might be able to say under the rules this is not an individual gift Kent said It s essentially a gift that has been made available to all personnel at that outpost There is also a statute that allows the secretary of the Army and his designees to accept gifts for the service that can be shared with soldiers he said You can have an instance where Starbucks says Hey Secretary we would like to donate worth of coffee to you on the condition that you make it available to soldiers who are assigned in Iraq or deployed overseas Kent explained Then we would pass it out with no favoritism But you can t just give it to officers or to senior NCOs Now it s the Army s coffee and the Army can do what it wants with it And the Army is going to follow the condition of the gift and make it available During Operation Desert Storm Busch Gardens offered free admission to all military members and their families another example of an offer that is covered by an exclusion to the gift rule he said Anheuser Busch theme parks still offers military members one free admission per year through its Waves of Honor program and other organizations such as Vet Tix offer donated and discounted tickets for service members to attend major sporting events and concerts Those perks are in the clear Kent said There is an exclusion that says you can accept gifts that are given to all federal employees or all Army employees Kent said If a commander called me and said Hey I heard about this promotion some of my soldiers want to go up to Busch Gardens and is it OK I d do my research and I would come back and say Yes it is acceptable There is an exclusion because Busch Gardens is offering this to all military personnel that allows them to accept the gift The same exception applies to Lowe s home improvement store s military discount because it s offered to all service members Kent said One exception to the gift rule that applies to this involves a Pentagon waiver that allowed only service members in the ranks of E and below to accept items other than cash worth more than from charitable and tax exempt veterans service organizations he added So for them it s separate If someone offers them a food bag or a turkey worth bucks they can accept it Kent said Kent s office will at times reach out to organizations offering deals that potentially violate the gift policy to help them be in compliance If we find out that someone is offering or trying to give someone a gift we usually will talk to them and say This is a problem Don t do this because they can t accept it he said Or sometimes we will tell them they can t accept it but maybe we could give them advice Well if you do it in another way then maybe they could accept it Most of these organizations they are on the up and up and they ve got no desire to get anyone in trouble They are trying to help people The rules for accepting gifts are a little bit complicated and often nuanced he said A lot of times they can do stuff if we just do certain things to get to the right area Kent said offering one more bit of advice It s never appropriate to accept a gift where the gift is being given with the intent to influence the soldier Matthew

Iranian Defense Ministry announced that it has acquired three new bomb capable unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs \u2013 more commonly known as drones \u2013 that are capable of flying almost miles and from an altitude of up to feet The announcement was made by Defense Minister Brig Gen Amir Hatami on state television on Saturday Hatami said the UAVs could also be used to monitor enemy movements from a considerable distance per a report by the Reuters News Agency The drones were reportedly manufactured by Iran s military industry with the participation from local universities Hatami added If the statements from Tehran are accurate that would rival the best drones that the United States and its allies are now flying in the Persian Gulf region In Iran also announced that it had developed three domestically produced precision guided smart bombs that could be installed on UAV platforms Drones are considered a key element in Iran s border surveillance efforts notably over the Gulf waters around the Strait of Hormuz where one fifth of the world s oil supply currently flows While the exact number of new drones wasn t made clear the Defense Ministry has said that it provided a mass delivery of the Ababil and Karar drones to the Islamic Republic s Air Force \u2013 but neither is capable of the range suggested by Hatami It is no secret that Iran has deployed drones in its efforts to combat ISIS and Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps has used the Ababil but it has a range of just 150km It is a redesign of earlier Iranian UAVs and is likely based on a South African platform which may have been borrowed from an older Israeli design The Karar UAV was also developed as a strategic weapon but according to reports from The Jerusalem Post the drone could be used in a kamikaze capacity much like a cruise missile Iran has also reportedly supplied these to the Houthi rebels in Yemen who have used the Karar against Saudi Arabia in dozens of attacks Iran has also sent some of the Karar drones to Syria s T base and one was shot down after it fly into Israeli airspace The U S Navy has successfully stopped some of Iran s shipments of drones and drone parts on the way to Yemen and this has included gyroscopes and other technology The timing for this latest drone announcement is noteworthy for a few reasons \u2013 the first that it would suggest a major leap forward in UAV technology for the Islamic Republic It was just last September that Brig Gen Alireza Sabahifard the head of the Islamic Republic s Air Force revealed the newly developed Kian UAV at a ceremony in Tehran It was reported to have a range of miles and could climb to an altitude of feet This newly announced drone would be significantly more sophisticated but as The Jerusalem Post s report noted Iran s unveiling was linked to its annual army day which was used to also highlight the nation s efforts in battling COVID The announcement could be a way to showcase that Iran s technological advances have continued despite the U S sanctions as well as the pandemic Until these new drones are actually used it is unclear whether these are an actual threat or just 21st century saber rattling

it worth the heavy price tag Keep reading to find out\u2026 Accuracy The SCAR is perfect if you need to shoot quickly and accurately partly thanks to some of its special features The big brake on the end of the barrel nearly eliminates muzzle rise and it\u2019s designed in a way that you can rack without breaking your grip or cheek weld to get more accuracy and speed with follow up shots With all the rounds I\u2019ve fired my average group size from meters is around inches It has good accuracy with cheap ammo and surprisingly great accuracy with heavier bullets as well If you\u2019re looking to shoot from a distance adding an optic can help maintain the accuracy from meters Reliability The SCAR is incredibly reliable I\u2019ve fired over rounds with no problems even when the gun was hot No malfunctions with feeding firing or ejecting to report it ran smooth with every round I fired I\u2019d say it\u2019s even more reliable than the AR platforms The gas piston system runs clean and is easy to service It is a consistent well built rifle that does everything you\u2019d expect it to without fail There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that it will have a very very long service life Handling This rifle is easy to use easy to maintain and incredibly versatile It\u2019s well balanced and light allowing for quick handling and shooting The ambidextrous controls are fully operable and can be adjusted to adapt to any shooter or position The controls are not in the way or otherwise burdensome as can sometimes be the case with ambidextrous controls The reciprocating charging handle does take a bit of getting used to and you have to be careful not to pinch your fingers between the handle and the holosight The big controls make reloading and switching from safe to fire quick and easy even when you\u2019re wearing gloves This is good because the rail tends to heat up quickly so you probably won\u2019t want to fire it excessively with bare hands The action is a short stroke gas piston with a rotating locking bolt and the short pull length makes for easy hammer pairs One of the best things about the SCAR is its adjustability The cheekpiece and stock are both adjustable and once you get them to the right position the rifle fits like a glove The buttstock folds quickly and the gun is fully operational like this It also comes with four Picatinny rails which let you get creative with scopes lasers and lights Cleaning is simple it takes five minutes max to disassemble and clean it fully Overall the handling and controls on the SCAR are clearly superior when compared to the AR Trigger The trigger on this gun is fantastic The reset is quick so you can shoot as fast as you want The module is made of composite polymer and the controls are big and easily accessible Even the trigger guard is enlarged allowing you to wear gloves without impeding use Magazine Reloading The SCAR has either a or round capacity and is compatible with most AR magazines Be careful with Gen PMAGs however because they could break the gun if used excessively It\u2019s made specifically for FN and standard USGI mags but I haven\u2019t had any issues feeding or otherwise with any magazine I\u2019ve used Reloading is simple mainly due to the large controls and the easily flowing side charging handle There\u2019s a magazine release on both sides to accommodate left and right handed shooters alike Your hand naturally flows to the handle after releasing the magazine you don\u2019t have to move the rifle your line of sight or even break your cheek weld to reload The release is recessed and shielded on both sides which keeps it in line with the receiver without hiding the release button Length Weight This is a pretty lightweight rifle around lbs The barrel length is just over \u201d and the overall length is between \u201d and \u201d depending on how you adjust the pull length and stock Recoil Management There\u2019s not much to discuss in terms of recoil because the SCAR is essentially recoil free This is pretty typical of a short barreled gas powered The big brake on the end of the barrel is really all the recoil management this gun needs Price One thing\u2019s for sure this is NOT a budget rifle The MSRP on the SCAR is around While there are other similar home defense rifles on the market for less the SCAR truly offers the most in versatility accuracy and overall value It\u2019s definitely expensive but a great reliable and accurate firearm if you can swing it My Verdict The SCAR is a reliable easy to use and versatile firearm It operates exactly as you\u2019d expect it to and is something you can rely on However this is not a cheap rifle You could find something similar on the market for much less but the SCAR is truly unmatched If you can get past the price tag it\u2019s definitely a keeper that is guaranteed to last for generations The best home defense rifles are durable lightweight and accurate and the SCAR hits all these marks If it\u2019s good enough for the U S Military then it\u2019s definitely good enough for you and I Richard Douglas is a firearms expert and educator His work has appeared in large publications like The

Godfather offers a seamless trip through his sprawling back catalogue and legacy Wiley\u2019s 11th album arrived in the fires of last decade\u2019s grime renaissance a revival that saw the genre shatter music industry glass ceilings and swarm across the country After landmark albums and single releases from Skepta and Stormzy Wiley followed up with an album heralded as his crowning glory a deserved victory lap to mark the success of a scene he had sacrificed himself to build a showcase of the undisputed craftsmanship and erratic genius that has come to define his reign Wiley\u2019s

Command Gen Webb is here to discuss the changes that AETC has implemented in response to COVID in order to protect the Air Force training pipelines and future airmen So before we get started Gen Webb do you have some opening remarks LIEUTENANT GENERAL MARSHALL B WEBB Thank you Ann Yes I do Good morning everyone I appreciate the opportunity for me to tell you how the Air Force is training during this pandemic What I d like to do is read a statement first as obviously this format may not allow everyone to get their questions in And my intent for this statement is to provide content that I anticipate will be on your mind So given that these are extraordinary times and as Gen Goldfein has said \u201cit s not business as usual it s business as required \u201d That s how we ve made our decisions about training during this crisis We are laser focused on the SECDEF s three priorities people which of course is ensuring to the utmost degree possible the safety of our airmen and families mission which of course is about national defense and partners which is a whole of nation response to this crisis Readiness Military readiness requires trained and available forces which equate directly to national security This is why after careful consideration we ve decided to continue mission essential training Rest assured our near peer adversaries are watching to see how we respond to this massive health threat We at AETC have airmen and space professionals in various pipelines and in order to maintain a trained force we must continue to bring in new recruits and train them Today our mission essential training is basic military technical and flying training as well as Officer Training School and Reserve Officer Training Corps First I d like to talk about basic military training or BMT In BMT we normally graduate about airmen each month If we stand this capability down for a month it will take a year to recover Now having said that we are not in full production of BMT Currently we are accepting only about new trainees every week instead of the usual to This decrease helps us improve our physical distancing We ve also implemented the following One we have placed new BMT trainees in a day restriction of movement or ROM upon arrival We started this procedure with the class that entered in on 17th of March We also have them in geographically separated training facilities at Joint Base San Antonio Lackland so that they don t have contact with trainees who have already started the BMT pipeline Two no new recruits reported to BMT last week to allow us time to implement new procedures based on our observations of our first two weeks of the ROM and also to deep clean dorms the dining facilities and other infrastructure in line with CDC guidance Three we ve implemented enhanced medical screening at entry at initial entry and during ROM Four we ve adjusted training to decrease exposure of trainees and military training instructors So far we ve realized only five positive trainees zero instructor positives and zero outbreaks to date thanks in large part to these proactive measures Additionally we re conducting BMT at Keesler Air Force Base Mississippi starting this week We chose Keesler because more than career fields accomplish technical training there and we ll limit trainees movement from BMT to their technical training location We call this a proof of concept and this proof of concept also provides relief to the Joint Base San Antonio Lackland infrastructure Finally we ve shortened BMT from eight and a half weeks to seven weeks in order to maximize training effectiveness and space utilization A variety of approaches are being used to shorten the training length such as decreased time spent on certain drill and ceremony items and streamlining the uniform issue process And I would note this is an example of business as required Moving to technical training After BMT airmen transfer to tech training a diverse enterprise which trains airmen in specialties at operating locations across the U S with a few detachments overseas To protect our tech trainees we ve empowered commanders to modify their training courses again an example of business as required to stay ahead of the curve Modification modifications range from splitting training into shifts to reduced class sizes using distance learning more and even using outdoor classrooms In some cases we re moving training forward and in others we ve deferred training that can only be completed in close quarters or in large groups Obviously it s a careful balance Flying training Regarding Undergraduate Pilot Training or UPT we ve currently \u2013 we\u2019re currently operating at reduced capacity because of enhanced health protection measures Most of our flying training wings are employing a what we call a blue silver teaming approach or have split into what s called pods meaning we re training in small groups of individuals notably around seven or eight at a time Our commanders have implemented various screening quarantine and isolation protocols to ensure to ensure mitigated risk for their teams While it s too early to know the full effects of COVID on our flying training pipeline we know it will be impactful Officer training Our ROTC cadets are completing their college education via distance learning Our Officer Training School at Maxwell Air Force Base has adopted some of the same precautions as I ve described in BMT to include medical screening restriction of movement and physical distancing I have just a quick word on recruiting Of course none of this training happens without our recruiting service Our mission starts with our amazing recruiters who are finding innovative ways to continue the mission during COVID Through the use of technology recruiters are maintaining their relationships with applicants and communicating during this time is obviously imperative Additionally recruiters are developing agile shipping methods to allow flexibility when Military Entrance Processing Stations or MEPS close due to COVID and we ve already seen some of that in various areas around the country MEPS locations are the first stop for recruits entering military service in the United States Should a MEPS location close recruiters can send recruits to adjacent MEPS locations to complete their final medical checks before going to BMT Communication is the single most important part of the process and we encourage all new applicants to stay in constant communication with their recruiter Across the enterprise we are following risk based measures consistent with guidance from the Department of Defense and CDC We continue to take actions to fight through COVID while balancing our responsibilities to deliver air and space power for our nation all while mitigating risk to communities airmen families and trainees as we execute our mission We appreciate our service members and their families for what they are doing in this time of crisis We appreciate the fact that you have entrusted your sons and daughters care to us We don t take that responsibility lightly I hope that s given you an idea of where we stand today in terms of Air Force training and I m happy to answer any questions Ann back to you STAFF Thanks Lita from A P do you have a question Q Hi yes Thank you General Two things One on recruiting are you seeing a reduction in the number of people who are coming in Is there a way you can sort of quantify that for us Because as you look out to the future are there fewer are you getting fewer recruits right now just because of the whole national COVID situation And then secondly on the training you gave us some numbers on the initial basic training COVID positive But more broadly across the force that you see within all your training what are the numbers of COVID positives Particularly if you have seen any among pilots and whether that s impacting any operational issues GEN WEBB OK thank you On the first question respective of recruiting numbers we ve been in kind of a I would say to the 99th percentile virtual at this point But we ve only been in that for less than two weeks So the data really isn t discernible yet on what we re seeing It s obviously of utmost importance I think especially in the recruiting area we have the opportunity now to never go back to old ways There s a lot of good virtual innovation that s occurring especially with respect to recruiting that I d be interested in retaining So the data will of course tell the tale of the tape on whether \u2013 whether you know we see a decrease in those numbers Too early to tell is the \u2013 is the bottom line to that one but very interested in it On the second one I know it was generally about the BMT positives that I ve articulated and I m glad to have a follow up if I don t hit the mark exactly on this one But with respect to BMTs across the force we re kind of keeping that in readiness channels and we ll be reporting that strictly through military channels from here on out And that obviously will include what s happening with the pilot force Over STAFF OK Sylvie do you have anything Sylvie from AFP Q Oh yes yes Hello Sorry yes I have a question Do you do you train foreign airmen And and did it change with the COVID GEN WEBB OK thank you The question do we train foreign airmen the answer to that is yes and as with all areas of training this hasn\u2019t \u2013 this obviously impacts all areas and it would also include our foreign partners as well They re adhering to protocols of their own nation as well as those of the United States Over Q You mean you are keep you keep training them STAFF You re continuing to train them GEN WEBB Yes We we I m sorry go ahead STAFF I was just repeating her question GEN WEBB Yeah the answer to the question is yes We continue to train our foreign partners that we have in the pipeline under the protocols that are both that the U S has set but also those that their nation has directed that they fall under Q OK thank you STAFF Ryan Browne from CNN Q Hello General Thank you for doing this You mentioned in your opening statement that you re only shipping about if my my cocktail napkin math is right of recruits to basic military training compared to your normal numbers And you said if you d stopped basic military training for a month that would set shipping for a month \u2013 that would set you back a year So given that you re only shipping how far is that setting you back GEN WEBB Yeah obviously it s going to set us back but we will be leaking at about half the rate we would have Now you re right it s about at a 60th percentile We had a little bit of cache that you would always expect of a training pipeline to do but we re going to eat into that the longer that this continues But our assessment of you know the protocols that we re operating under are that we have it at the appropriate level So you know I wouldn t want to leave you with an impression that this doesn t affect our ability in any of our pipelines because it does But we are as elegantly as we can navigating the risk to force and the risk to mission kind of aspects of keeping after readiness to the extent that we can Q And if I could just ask one thank you And if I could just ask one follow up at this current rate what is your tipping point in terms of when will it be kind of an unacceptable level of risk if you re at this at this rate How long can you go until you reach kind of an unacceptable tipping point GEN WEBB Well we\u2019ll continue to assess that with the leadership of the Air Force Obviously we ll be watching you know the numbers that we have in the Air Force and the particular specialty codes that are being filled directly correlates to Air Force readiness So you know we are in a obviously a reduced to some amount degree of training Our assessment is that we don t have to take other measures such as stop loss which of course has been being discussed inside of Washington We re not at that point yet If this were to continue for an extraordinary amount of time and by that I mean multiples of months we would probably have to we as the Department of Defense certainly the Air Force continue to assess when we d have to take other measures We re not there at this point and we re really kind of taking it day by day and week by week to see what we can get done on our end of the pipeline Over Q Thank you STAFF Sig Christenson from San Antonio Express News Q Good morning General Thanks for doing this today I wonder we \u2013 we have talked about this amongst a few people I know If you continue to not get enough people into basic training why\u2019d you end up going to stop loss to compensate for the difference that s happened before certainly during the Iraq War GEN WEBB Say again I missed the crux of the question Was that how or why I missed the actual question part of that Q OK I ll try again I may have had the \u2013 I may have the wrong button pushed here Given that you are losing people in the pipeline and it s even possible I suppose if you could stop the pipeline again for a longer period than just one week If you ended up doing that could you go to stop loss Would you \u2013 would you recommend going to stop loss if you are losing people in the recruiting pipeline at a rate that you can t make up for That s my question GEN WEBB Oh OK So that the decision on whether to go to stop loss will be a decision that will be made at the senior levels the very senior most levels of the Air Force And so what I ll be providing is our assessment of what we can train which of course I ve just kind of articulated to you and the personnelists on the air staff will be providing an assessment of what that does in the over the duration of months And we ll make a jointly probably arrived at recommendation for the chief But believe this We are looking at this on a daily if not weekly basis on what this does to our readiness That s how we ll arrive at a point if we arrive at that point for a stop loss decision Q Then I have a quick follow up to that Is there a when Is there a point where you would have to make that decision Have you identified the point where you would have to make a decision on that GEN WEBB No we haven t identified a point at this time We re at an absolute decision point STAFF OK Lucas Tomlinson from Fox News Q General for years the Air Force had a pilot shortage What is this pandemic doing to that shortage GEN WEBB Well it s not helping Laughter Obviously our the impact to our ability to navigate a blue and silver flight construct is eats into our production capabilities That s the bad news On the good news side is generally you see in times of crisis is another great example of that where whether it s patriotism or job opportunities or what have you we tend to see those that may be getting out or those that have recently gotten out want to return to service inside of our Air Force I expect that we ll see some of that to a degree which will help mitigate that This is another one that we re going to be assessing on a weekly if not daily basis Over STAFF Jennifer from Air Force Magazine Q Hi General Thank you for taking the time My question is since you commented on the closure of the Military Entrance Processing Stations I was wondering if you could possibly provide the number of how many stations have been shuttered as of the last count you were provided so that we can get an idea of the kind of level of the issue GEN WEBB Yes The number I don t know the exact number of stations that have closed It s been several But they don t necessarily stay closed So if they have a situation where they ve had a positive or for whatever reason they ve decided to close their station the stations close and then can potentially open That has been the case in some Some I think have remained closed and I m honestly it does change on a daily basis and I don t know what that number is currently Over Q OK And then I have a follow up would be are there any initial lessons learned that have been coming in from the I guess the in processing stage of the BMT proof of concept at Keesler GEN WEBB Well sorry I might have hit the button talked before I hit the button I mean we re on day two or day three you know really of this It s obviously there are much smaller numbers That there s going to be some usefulness that comes out of that from the ability to get to classes and to kind of you know you re in a smaller group that ll we expect to see some efficiencies I really think it s too close too early to tell Let us get about a week under our belt and then I think we ll start really getting an assessment And obviously this is a proof of concept so we really want to take the time to assess you know the full kind of panoply of that training before we decide if this is a continuation as a good viable alternative Over STAFF Oriana Pawlyk from Military com Q Hey sir Thanks for doing this So I wanted to go back to BMT real quick You had mentioned some numbers there and I m curious what happens to airmen in flights who have been exposed to airmen that have tested positive for COVID What does the process look like there Do you separate those airmen Where do they go Where do they even quarantine Do they have to you know start their training all over again I mean just what does that look like GEN WEBB Yeah thanks Oriana When we have a positive you know which I told you we ve had five here in the last well since we started the procedures the 17th of March We have a cadre of folks called public health officials that run forensics on who may have been exposed In this case we re talking about trainees A trainee in the environment they were in And we sequestered them They are either placed after medical testing in quarantine or they go into and this is a medical term PUI persons under investigation And I mean that in a medical sense investigation if they if we think that they are exhibiting symptoms So when you have a positive it does tend to impact decent chunks of numbers They go through medical testing and if there are no symptoms and you know there are protocols medical protocols whereby they can be once they ve cleared testing they rejoin their flights or their formations to continue with the training Those that are deemed still need to be investigated stay in that status And so we ve done that now for like I said we ve had five COVID positives This morning we are up to four of the COVID positives are returning to the general population of trainee They do not start over at zero day We do an assessment of where we think they are with respect to training And they will either rejoin the flight they were originally in or they may be set back a class or two We go through an assessment of that That\u2019s those are for the COVID positives So you can imagine those that are under quarantine that have passed protocols in a hurry they aren t sequestered for nearly as long and they ve already returned to training So that I think that gives you a general sense of how we re assessing this Over Q And a quick follow up Aside from airmen have any instructors or any you know just any instructors athletic or the folks that they would see with day to day have they tested positive to your knowledge GEN WEBB Right so if you have a positive and public health officials assess that an MTI a military training instructor would ve been exposed they too go into the quarantine protocols and we have had those I don t have the exact figures in front of me but I can tell you we ve had zero zero MTIs test positive as they ve gone through this through the protocols Over STAFF Abraham from Washington Examiner Q Yeah thank you General for taking my question Could you talk a bit about the pipeline for space professionals Are you on track to graduate on time What are the numbers I know that Gen Raymond recently said that the Air Force Academy had cadets who were supposed to graduate in May And if you re not on track what are your new projections and how is recruiting and on boarding going for space professionals Thank you GEN WEBB Thanks Abraham I m going to have to circle back with you on the exact numbers of our trainees that will be headed to Space Force As you may or may not be tracking we have not separated pipelines yet We re working with Gen Raymond to do this on a deliberate basis and are you know in discussions with how he wants to proceed forward You know we re pre decisional on whether he decides they will stay with Air Force basic training or they ll develop their own and be in a different location or maybe they ll be at the same base but a different wing Those are conversations that are ongoing But for right now those that have been or will be identified as Space are continuing just like all of the airmen that I ve been addressing so far in BMT go So we re kind of pre decisional on the breakout and for the specifics AFSCs that we have in the pipeline right now identified for space I don t have them I ll have to have our PA folks circle back with you on that Q So basically it s sort of that same level then is applied you would guess sort of across Space Force as well GEN WEBB Yeah if I was to hazard a guess I d say it would be the same as the general population numbers of it would be in that percentage Over STAFF Courtney Albon from Inside Defense Q Hi Thanks for thanks for doing this In an earlier discussion around the pipeline you had mentioned there s a cache in your training pipeline that eventually as this continues you ll start to eat into Can you talk a little bit about what that means that you eat into that cache but also at what point you expect based on the current situation at what point you expect to start eating into that GEN WEBB Yeah I did I did say that we had a degree of cache It s not that extensive obviously If we had that much fluff in the system we would have leaned that out a long time ago And we did take a reschedule week last week as you know We received zero trainees so now we re hitting on a or whatever that percentage pace is So we re going to be eating into it in very short order I don t have the exact you know date that we\u2019ll start eating into it But if we haven t started this week or the next week it ll be very soon Over Q OK thanks STAFF And Ms Garnier from Newsy Q Yes good morning Thank you for taking my question Can you give some examples of what exactly is being done during training to adhere to social distancing guidelines And then I have a follow up after that one GEN WEBB OK yeah Well we you know in line with the Secretary of Defense s guidance with respect to PPE or personal protective equipment we re adhering to all of those You will have seen all our trainees and trainers with the masks and gloves et cetera where appropriate We ve also taken to the six foot distancing on all the training We have spread out classroom dorm room and dining facility distances So you can imagine the infrastructure there everything gets spread out So more infrastructure is taken up More MTIs or training instructors are needed to enable the appropriate training conditions to continue And then we ve just made an assessment on what training needs to be modified so that this is again business as required not business as usual We continue to advance basic training but without violating the physical distancing to the utmost extent that we can and still produce a viable airmen Over Q Are trainees still required to like sleep on bunkbeds Cause I know in when I was in basic training you were in large bays with bunkbeds and like everyone had to shower in one shower at the same time So are some of those things being changed as well And then also once the airmen go to tech school are their living situations changed as well So are they going to have their own rooms or are they still going to be bunked up with other airmen How has that changed as well GEN WEBB Yeah so if you have a mental picture of a open bay barracks and then numbers I don t have \u2013 I don\u2019t know the exact numbers that are in a room but it s about half of that So you have bunks where it\u2019s basically the dorms that I ve walked through here in the last couple of weeks you have a single bed followed by a bunkbed followed by a single bed followed by a bunkbed and they re spread out So you have about half the number that you would have to ensure that we keep the physical distancing And you ll note I m using that term physical distancing as opposed to social distancing intentionally so that we you know just mentally we stay in the mindset of hey socially connected physically distanced But we keep that appropriate That applies in BMT it also applies the same way in technical training schoolhouse as well Over STAFF So is there Q Just one more STAFF OK sure Q General is it really the same experience that those instructors aren t blasting the recruits like an inch away from their faces and sometimes you know by accident spit does go on them GEN WEBB The training instructors are adhering to the physical distancing just like the rest of us and that has been instructed We are using the facemasks and the PPE in all of our training Over Q But is it the same experience General GEN WEBB Well I mean it isn t exactly the same I would tell you I keep returning to the chief s phrase cause he phrased it the best this is business as required not business as usual Q Thank you STAFF Is there anyone else on the phone that joined late that has a question they d like to ask CROSSTALK Q \u2026 may I ask a question STAFF Go ahead Was there another question Go ahead Q \u2026 inaudible GEN WEBB Hey Ann Ann I didn t quite get to finish that my statement If I could just finish that one piece on is it the same experience I can tell you having been out there five times in the last two weeks the MTIs are very effective at getting their training done even with the physical distancing and the other procedures that we ve put in place OK that was the end of that one Back to you STAFF Thank you General This is Tara Copp with McClatchy I wanted to get a few more details on the move of some training to Keesler Will the airmen be bussed down there What is Keesler doing to prepare to house them How many airmen are you talking about and how are you going to recreate that experience down there Thank you GEN WEBB Right So Keesler s under way They received their first tranche well their their proof of concept tranche on Tuesday The number that we ve targeted is We have military training instructors that we have flown over to Keesler Air Force Base from Lackland to be part of that experience We have the proper you know ratios of training to trainees there and it s really replicated We have the ability to do all of the kind of basic the very you know first week all the way through end week training done to include the field experience opportunities there in Mississippi as we do in Lackland Over Q And after the proof of concept tranche how many do you envision going through Keesler GEN WEBB Right I think right now while I won t you can t hold me to this you know forever cause we maybe need to make adjustments or may see the opportunity to make adjustments but we think is the right figure You know be appreciative that Keesler does a vast bulk of our technical training as well So it s not like the base is empty But we do have the capacity for sure for If our proof of concept you know proves out and we make the decision to continue with this Over Q Got it And just one clarification you mean with each incoming flight like over and over not total correct GEN WEBB That s right per tranche Now we\u2019re doing one right now until we are satisfied that the proof of concept is successful So in other words you won t see another happen on Tuesday coming upcoming until I make the decision that this is something that we want to do that\u2019s viable I don t expect that probably for another three or four weeks because I want to get through the field part of the training to have assessed it in its entirety Over Q Thank you STAFF OK General Webb do you have any closing comments GEN WEBB Yes I do thank you We share the same sentiment as everyone else in that we ve never seen anything like this We ve all deployed and fought enemies abroad However today s enemy is here in our communities This reality affects all of us including our families It s a challenge that we must fight through We don t know what new normal will look like until we get to the other side Regardless of the challenges we face our mission remains the same to create ready and lethal airmen who fuel the Air and Space Force That mission and our standards will not change Within inaudible we\u2019ve adopted the hashtag CalmIsContagious We re asking our members to trust in their leaders Commanders at all levels are working hard and making tough decisions in an environment where there are no easy answers Physical distancing teleworking restriction of movement none of that is easy We re making decisions to protect our military and our communities as best we can and they will change as we go through this together We stand together to fight through this Please be safe take care of each other and thank you everybody for your time today Thank you Ann STAFF Thanks everybody for joining us today If you have any follow up questions please get with Marilyn Holliday at Air Education and Training Command or feel free to shoot me a note as well Thank you Eds Note Gen Webb was referring to COVID positives across the force here", "page_url":

Information Security Officer Mark Hillick Director of Security Clint Sereday Anti Cheat Product Lead Daniel Hu Data Privacy Product Lead and Warren Kenny Application Security Product Lead And we\u2019re here to talk about Riot Vanguard We\u2019ve discussed Vanguard in the past but over the last week there\u2019s been a lot of conversation about Vanguard and its kernel mode driver The biggest concerns we\u2019re hearing are about the security of the driver and your privacy Our buddy Paul \u201cRiot Arkem\u201d Chamberlain has been addressing questions where he can but as a group of the most unapologetically paranoid Rioters we wanted to give Riot Arkem a little backup and give you some added insight into how Vanguard was built with security and privacy at its heart A Little Background on Riot Security A few years ago we wrote about how security has evolved at Riot We described our approach as being the guardian of Riot\u2019s player focused culture feedback driven and audience focused and centered around providing options not roadblocks This is as true in as it was in The Anti Cheat team made sure Vanguard was designed with our Security and Data Privacy teams coordinating closely at every stage of development We understand the decision to run the driver component in kernel mode can raise concerns and that some of you want to know more about the tech behind Vanguard We can\u2019t get too deep into the technical specifics without potentially compromising Vanguard but we\u2019ll go as far as we safely can below plus we can assure you that it has been reviewed by both internal and external security experts The bottom line is we would never let Riot ship anything if we weren\u2019t confident it treated player privacy and security with the extreme seriousness they deserve With that in mind let\u2019s look at our philosophy for Vanguard and the fundamentals of its architecture Riot Vanguard Philosophy Riot\u2019s committed to achieving the highest competitive integrity in our games We want you to play in a world where you never have to doubt your abilities or your opponent\u2019s The battle against cheats is constantly evolving and we\u2019re always working on better ways of accomplishing our goals Cheating has gone from merely seeking control of game client memory to methods that attempt to modify the underlying operating system If anti cheat software is only run in user mode its capabilities would be compromised by a cheat running at a higher privilege level For example some of the more advanced cheating communities have used Direct Memory Access DMA to rebroadcast memory to a separate computer for later processing Vanguard is a solution that will help us achieve the vision of competitive integrity while enabling us to continuously adapt our arsenal in the war against cheaters Vanguard does not collect or process any personal information beyond what the current League of Legends anti cheat solution does Riot does not want to know more about you or your machine than what is necessary to maintain high integrity in your game The game data we collect is used for the operation of the game and integrity related services such as Packman and Vanguard Riot Vanguard Architecture Vanguard consists of three components the client driver and platform The client user mode handles all of the anti cheat detections while a game is running The client needs to communicate with the platform to receive detections and in order for a player to be able to play The client does not consider a machine trusted unless it recognizes the driver untrusted machines cannot play VALORANT The driver kernel mode is used by the client to validate memory and system state and to make sure the client has not been tampered with The driver runs at start up to prevent loading cheats prior to the client initialization The driver can be uninstalled at any time \u201cRiot Vanguard\u201d in Add Remove Programs although VALORANT won\u2019t run without it The driver does not collect or send any information about your computer back to us The driver has been signed by Riot\u2019s own EV cert which has in turn been signed by Microsoft as per their code signing process What\u2019s Next As part of our commitment to player security and privacy we\u2019ve been running a Bug Bounty program on HackerOne for the past years We\u2019ve rewarded security researchers with almost two million dollars in bounties and our scope includes everything that players interact with Today we\u2019re announcing that we\u2019re creating a special scope for Vanguard vulnerabilities with even higher bounties We want players to continue to play our games with peace of mind and we\u2019re putting our money where our mouth is If you think you\u2019ve found a flaw in Vanguard that would undermine the security and privacy of players please submit a report right away and you may be eligible for a big bounty payout Visit our HackerOne page for more details We\u2019d never let Riot ship something we couldn\u2019t stand behind from a player trust perspective not that we think Riot would ever try Players have every right to question and challenge us but let\u2019s be clear\u2014 we wouldn\u2019t work here if we didn\u2019t deeply care about player trust and privacy and believe that Riot feels the same way We\u2019re players just like you and we wouldn\u2019t install programs on our computer that we didn\u2019t have the utmost confidence in Please keep holding us accountable for protecting both the competitive integrity of your games and your personal privacy", "page_url": "https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/a-message-about-vanguard-from-our-security-privacy-teams", "label": 1, "score": "210705_news_159768"},

that they then downloaded 500GB of private projects and initially planned on selling it but has now decided to leak it for free Based on the file stamps in full directory listing of the leaked files the breach may have occurred on March 28th Leaked data listing showing the breach date Shiny Hunters told BleepingComputer that they no longer have access to Microsofts GitHub account Private

interesting such as ones named some wssd cloud agent a The Rust WinRT language projection and a PowerSweep PowerShell project Overall from what was shared there does not appear to be anything significant for Microsoft to worry about as it did not contain more sensitive code for software like Windows or Office Cyber intelligence firm Under the Breach who also saw the leak on the hacker

Vietnam War was dismal Navy fighter jets launching from aircraft carriers on \u201cYankee Station \u201d flew air to air and air to ground missions over North Vietnam The North Vietnamese sortied their own fighter jets Soviet built MiGs to shoot down American aviators resulting in intense aerial combat between the two forces From June to September U S aircraft fired nearly air to air missiles In nearly engagements the likelihood of a kill was one per ten missiles shot and the kill ratio between U S aviators and the North Vietnam Air Force was two to one In the Korean War American fighters had enjoyed a to ratio in World War II the Navy F6F Hellcat fighter\u2019s kill ratio was to Something needed to change The Navy directed Captain Frank Ault to assess what went wrong He published his findings in The Report of the Air to Air Missile System Capability Review commonly known as \u201c The Ault Report \u201d The report led to the creation of the Navy Fighter Weapons School or TOPGUN Ault singled out two major problems with fighter squadron training and readiness First F Phantom II pilots were not firing enough air to air missiles in training to prepare them for employing the missiles in combat Next the multi role Phantom was being over used for air to ground missions resulting in aviators unskilled in aerial combat The Navy consequently refocused on air to air employment and by the end of the conflict the kill ratio improved significantly to as high as to Modern U S Navy F A Super Hornet squadrons find themselves in circumstances similar to those Ault investigated in Current Navy strike fighter squadrons do not fire enough air to air missiles and their training mission profiles are too fragmented between air to air air to ground and other mission areas In a future conflict with China or Russia as in the past naval aviators should expect these deficiencies to yield combat losses unless they are mitigated in peacetime The Navy should increase missile firing allowances for strike fighter squadrons and explore ways to specialize squadrons for either fighter air to air or attack air to ground roles We\u2019ll Do it Live American naval aviators need more practice firing air to air missiles Currently firing an air to air missile in training is a rare event It requires weeks or months of planning occasional squadron detachments to other airfields and the right combination of training range availability support assets logistics and more Many aviators go their entire career without firing a missile Those who do typically get just one opportunity Training requirements for the F A Super Hornet the Navy\u2019s mainstay strike fighter are governed by a training \u201cmatrix \u201d a spreadsheet that outlines every task required for a squadron to be considered ready for combat The matrix states that before deploying each fleet squadron must shoot four missiles two AIM infrared guided missiles and two AIM radar guided missiles The training requirements for the F 35C Lightning II \u2014 currently equipping just one operational squadron and destined to comprise one quarter of the Navy\u2019s strike fighter fleet \u2014 are still in development The Ault Report meanwhile recommends that the Navy \u201cprovide F4 sic pilots with one each AIM and AIM per pilot during Fleet Replacement Squadron training and two each\u2026 per pilot per year in fleet squadrons thereafter \u201d Current FA student aviators fire no air to air missiles during their training perhaps due to the expense and complexity of doing so Fleet squadrons are only assured of shooting the mandated four missiles per two year cycle Vietnam era aviators fired missiles in exercises and in combat and still performed poorly against the North Vietnam Air Force As a result Ault recommended an increase in live missile allowances The report focused on the \u201ckill ratio \u201d that is how many North Vietnamese planes were shot down compared to American planes and on the ratio of missiles fired compared to missiles that hit their targets In both were tilted strongly against the Americans Using this methodology to describe missile firing allowances Ault\u2019s recommendation of two missiles per student was a ratio of to Meanwhile the current missile to student ratio is to For operational fleet squadrons Ault recommended a ratio of missiles for every one pilot every year while the modern missile to pilot per year ratio is about to see Figure below Ault\u2019s focus on firing live missiles stemmed from improper missile employment resulting in a high number of misses Vietnam era aircraft with analog computers and vacuum tube radars required constant tweaking to ensure reliable missile performance problems today\u2019s computer driven aircraft largely avoid Modern software simulated missile training modes and flight simulators provide aircrew with combat realistic indications without firing half million dollar weapons while \u201cheads up\u201d and helmet mounted displays provide missile data without the need to check cockpit displays However these solutions only go so far The first time a live missile leaves your aircraft is a unique experience Like the first time driving alone with your driver\u2019s license there are numerous items to check and recheck procedures to follow and a feel to the experience that no simulation can replicate Sometimes More is More Defenders of current missile allowances will say that expensive complicated missiles cannot be \u201cwasted\u201d on peacetime firings while software and simulations are readily available The problem is that simulations cannot replicate the psychological and physiological effects on a pilot when firing a real missile at a real target Although simulation capabilities and aircraft integration have improved exponentially since there is no substitute for the real thing Concerns about expense are not unreasonable The inflation adjusted per unit cost of a Vietnam era AIM 7E missile is approximately while an AIM 9D is estimated at Capt Ault\u2019s plan to give every pilot in every squadron four missiles a year plus the RAG allocations approximately pilots in fighter squadrons in would cost million annually in dollars Today\u2019s missiles the AIM 120C and the AIM 9X Block II each cost approximately and respectively A program of two of these weapons each per pilot per year would cost million in missiles alone assuming that in each of the fleet F squadrons had pilots that each of the F squadrons had pilots and that students trained per year in each of the three fighter training squadrons Fortunately the lasting impacts of Ault\u2019s other recommendations mean that the number of missiles once required in can be pared down today Technological improvements in aircraft and simulators permit practicing the mechanics of missile firing much more easily than in Tying missile allocation to a squadron\u2019s workup cycle reduces the number of pilots who need to shoot annually Issuing one AIM 120C and one AIM 9X to each deploying pilot during the two year workup cycle brings the costs closer to Capt Ault\u2019s program If four air wings each comprised of four FA squadrons deploy annually two missiles per deploying pilot would cost million annually assuming approximately Fleet pilots for all FA squadrons with pilots deploying annually Figure Missile allowances outlined by the Ault Report top current requirements middle and the author bottom along with a \u201ckill ratio\u201d of annual missiles per pilot assuming a pilot squadron currently the combat strength manning of most VFA squadrons Data compiled by the author Little \u201cf\u201d Big \u201cA\u201d The F A Super Hornet is too overtasked with air to ground missions to be an effective air to air fighter In both training and combat the FA has been more \u201cattack\u201d than \u201cfighter \u201d Given that both missions \u2014 air to air and air to ground \u2014 are becoming more complex it\u2019s increasingly difficult to excel at both Aerial combat is a constantly evolving battleground with increasingly capable sensors electronic attack capabilities evolving weapons and changing tactics Fighter aviators must excel at long range missile duels but due to electronic jamming stealth capabilities and rules of engagement they must also be ready to take the fight to \u201cthe visual arena \u201d where aggressive maneuvering and quick thinking make the difference between victory and defeat Meanwhile air to ground missions grow increasingly complex as \u201cdumb\u201d unguided bombs are replaced and augmented with \u201csmart\u201d weapons that rely on a variety of guidance systems and incorporate advanced technologies to hit enemy targets from long distances The likelihood of heavily defended targets and complex weapon to target pairing mean the days of plugging a latitude and longitude into the weapon\u2019s computer alone may not get the bombs on target From through FA squadrons maintained a training profile similar to Phantom combat operations from through Flight hour data from this period for East Coast based FA squadrons show a nearly even split between air to air and air to ground missions at and percent respectively Figure Figure Percentage of FA flight hours by mission area Data compiled by the author Routine navigational maintenance and qualification flights comprise nearly a quarter of FA flight hours Removing these hours from the comparison increases the apparent percentages of air to air and air to ground flight hours without changing their proportions relative to each other FA combat operations are almost completely air to ground missions Including those hours with air to ground training increases its proportion to percent Fig Squadrons also supplement air to air training with \u201c red air \u201d sorties simulating enemy aircraft Including these hours with air to air numbers yields an air to air share of percent Master of the Skies Naval aviators should specialize in either air to air or air to ground missions The temptation to do both should be avoided as it will lead pilots to becoming a jack of all trades masters of none If Ault were alive to examine FA mission tasking today he would discover that little has changed since Vietnam Like today\u2019s FA the F could shift between air to air and air to ground missions a multi role aircraft However Ault an attack aviator argued that this flexibility was a detriment In the two and a half years prior to the Ault Report Navy F aircrews were flying more air to ground than air to air from through percent of Phantom sorties were air to air and percent were air to ground Focusing on air to ground missions dulled the edge on air to air capability combining with systems deficiencies and air to air training cutbacks to yield the poor performance that spurred the Ault Report From through the F averaged a flight hour breakdown of percent air to air and percent air to ground with various other tasks comprising the remainder Fig These numbers represent combat sorties with enemy ground defenses and aircraft shooting back In such an environment where success was the difference between life and death Capt Ault determined that the emphasis on air to ground was affecting air to air combat performance In Ault\u2019s words found purchase F air to air missions comprised percent of F combat sorties in On the home front F air to air training increased and improved However the conclusion of Operation Rolling Thunder and a scaling back of the air war in North Vietnam meant the results of focused air to air training would remain unknown until President Nixon established Operation Linebacker in That year bore the fruit of the TOPGUN program with aerial victories for the F \u201cWith the right tactics and training the F became a true MiG killer \u201d Both datasets \u2013 Vietnam and modern squadrons \u2013 are subject to important caveats The Vietnam data accounts only for sorties flown in support of combat operations Navigational training and other non combat flights are not included Additionally West Coast based F squadrons deployed more frequently than East Coast squadrons which typically deployed to the Atlantic and Mediterranean In the modern era the FA \u2019s multi role capabilities occlude the data a sortie classified as an air to ground flight may have some air to air training involved and vice versa Additionally the data does not include West Coast air wings including Japan based CVW which does not deploy to the Middle East Still over a timespan of several years trends persist in both the Vietnam and modern era data If a near split in intense combat was not enough to ensure aerial victory in a heavy air to ground emphasis in is unlikely to yield a different result Master of None Hardware is not the immediate answer for combat aviation just as it wasn\u2019t for Ault Building new aircraft may solve some problems but not all of them Likewise building specialized new aircraft takes too long Adjusting training on the other hand could be done tomorrow After Vietnam defense planners seemingly learned different lessons than those in the Ault Report The multi role nature of the F became a value rather than a hurdle overcome by training following dismal performance Post Vietnam air to air advocates Air Force officers dubbed \u201cThe Fighter Mafia \u201d wanted to develop fighters like the Vietnamese MiG \u2014 light agile focused on air to air they would be simple cheap single role fighters Col John Boyd proponent of the \u201cOODA Loop\u201d and the \u201cE M diagram\u201d of fighter performance sketched the F and F fighters in line with these principles but grew frustrated by the decisions to bulk up the F and to transform the F into a multi role fighter bomber Born from the same program as the F the Navy\u2019s FA Hornet promised to deliver on the multi role potential of the F thanks to modern digital technology \u2014 even though the most comprehensive study of Phantom performance in Vietnam specifically cited multi role focus as a detractor from air to air capability The post Cold War \u201cpeace dividend\u201d reduced the need for an air to air thoroughbred and tightened budgets to the point that multi role aircraft became the only affordable option The Air Force\u2019s F became known for a brief period as the \u201cF A \u201d in a vain attempt to give the aircraft multi role credibility and save the Raptor\u2019s production line At sea the carrier air wing withered from a multi airframe multi mission complementary suite of aircraft into a uniform collection of Super Hornets The F 35C beginning to populate flight decks augments the carrier air wing with improved sensors and all aspect stealth However its common moniker \u2014 \u201cJoint Strike Fighter\u201d \u2014 betrays it as another jack of all trades a legacy of the F and FA Notably the Ault report does not recommend building purebred fighters to solve the Navy\u2019s MiG problem Such a suggestion would not have fixed the immediate problems in and such a suggestion posed in would not produce results for years to come with the introduction of new aircraft The Navy\u2019s use of \u201cF A XX\u201d to describe its next generation fighter is a clear indication that developing separate fighter and attack aircraft is unlikely Figure Breakdown of flight hours by mission area for the F Phantom II left and the FA Super Hornet right Combat strike operations have been added to the air to ground hours while \u201cred air\u201d sorties are counted in the air to air total Some non tactical training flight hours have been omitted from the FA data for clarity Data compiled by the author Fight the Matrix The multi role fighter is here to stay However recent air to air engagements in Syria and India demonstrate that the need for a competently trained within visual range gun equipped dogfighter has not abated since the Phantom\u2019s dark days Rules of engagement identification requirements and escalation of force protocols constrain the ability to shoot down enemy aircraft Fighter pilots should expect the same in future conflicts in the crowded skies over the South China Sea or Eastern Europe The time to leverage a greater split in air to air and air to ground training is now Although Super Hornet and the F are flexible strike fighter aircraft the \u201cman in the box\u201d is the legacy of the Ault Report Beyond technological solutions and procurement reforms Ault understood that Phantom crews needed to be honed to a razor\u2019s edge in air to air combat The F benefited from entire \u201ccarrier attack wings\u201d of air to ground aircraft providing the space needed to refocus the Phantom on air to air execution With the attack squadron gone from the carrier deck since Super Hornet squadrons would benefit from informal re designations to attack air to ground and fighter air to air squadrons instead of the current \u201cstrike fighter squadron\u201d moniker The training matrix beyond spelling out missile allocation mandates the \u201ctasks\u201d that each aviator must periodically perform Generally the matrix splits the requirements for air to air and air to ground tasks equally Creating two Super Hornet training matrices one with an air to air focus and one tilted towards air to ground would allow the Navy to develop more focused aviators The Navy could direct each FA squadron to assume a particular role but a more interesting experiment would be to allow carrier air wing commanders to allocate the matrices for their FA squadrons In this way an air wing commander could tailor the wing according to operational priorities The problem with dividing the carrier air wing is that the Navy does not operate in a multi role world For nearly years it has lived in the strike domain supporting ground forces ashore Squadron skippers will be loath to orbit the carrier waiting for MiGs while the best hunting is ashore and on deck In Desert Storm for example F 14s were marginalized with overwater combat air patrols while Air Force F 15s decimated the Iraqi Air Force Meanwhile Navy attack squadrons and the new FA Hornet flew \u201cfeet dry \u201d dropping ordnance all over the desert Adding insult to injury Hornets shot down two MiGs while the mighty Tomcats had to content themselves with a lone defenseless Iraqi helicopter What Naval Aviation Should Be Doing Naval aviation should stop strike operations ashore in Iraq Syria and Afghanistan increase missile firing allowances and specialize each FA squadron for either the fighter or attack role Combat close air support ashore in the Middle East has become increasingly marginal for carrier air wings Critics will say that the aircraft carrier adds strike power to forces in the Middle East which is true but the need is no longer there Since manned strike sorties in Iraq Syria and Afghanistan have fallen by half Recent aircraft carrier deployments have refocused on the much ballyhooed \u201cnear peer threat \u201d carriers spend fewer days in the Arabian Gulf launching strike sorties and more time on the high seas practicing for high end combat Refocusing on problems away from \u201cthe beach\u201d may not yield as much footage for the post cruise video but it will allow air wing commanders to tinker with a mix of fighters and strikers The infrequency of missile firings must be corrected through increased allowances Modern technological advancements mean that a to missile ratio in can accomplish what Ault sought in with a to ratio Simulations can only go so far to replicate the firing of an actual missile however and so there is ultimately no substitute for the real thing For example the Navy\u2019s most recent MiG Killer Lt Cmdr Mike Tremmel stated that he knew to anticipate a long firing sequence for his missile and how to avoid debris from a Syrian Su based on his experience firing a real missile in training Although the cost in dollars may be high advances in technology mean that fewer live missiles are required today compared to Tremmel\u2019s experience proves that there is indeed no substitute for the real thing and his ability to shoot and maneuver benefitted from having practiced with a real missile The cost in American lives and jets saved may be tough to measure but it certainly outweighs the costs of several dozen missiles Building more flexibility into FA training matrices would allow wing commanders to specialize their air wings for operational requirements If commanders could specialize their squadrons during pre deployment workups they might find that squadrons with more bombing experience are better bombers and those with more fighting experience are better fighters The workup cycle includes a wide variety of missions on which to test these assumptions but the jack of all trades nature of the training matrix leaves little room for specialization Loosening the matrix opens the floodgates for commanders to pick and choose the missions they like and avoid the ones they don\u2019t Skippers who fancy themselves \u201cMaverick\u201d Mitchell may leave the bombs at home while those who are more of a \u201cCool Hand\u201d Grafton may ditch the missiles Giving air wing commanders the responsibility for specialization ensures that each air wing is appropriately balanced and allows commanders the flexibility to emphasize a particular mission area if required The Key to Victory Increasing missile allowances to one AIM and one AIM per pilot per workup cycle and giving air wing commanders the ability to specialize squadrons for air to air and air to ground missions will prevent the Navy from a repeat of the early Vietnam War The lack of familiarity with missile employment and the parity between air to air and air to ground missions in Vietnam yielded unacceptable losses and poor performance Expecting modern technology alone to yield different results is the same shortsightedness that led to the Ault Report These two recommendations amount to an \u201counce of prevention\u201d that will keep American aviators alive and provide the key to victory in future combat highly trained expert fighter aircrew Examining the Navy\u2019s poor combat performance Capt Ault concluded that increased missile allowances focused air to air training at home and fighter mission execution in combat would tip the scales in favor of naval aviation History proved Ault correct Navy Phantoms achieved percent their total kills in the last two years of the war It took the death of many aviators and the failure of millions of dollars in equipment to spur change in but the Navy can change now and avoid the high costs of learning through failure in war Capt Ault\u2019s conclusion that a jack of all trades was no match for a focused fighter pilot turned the tide half a century ago The same focus should guide FA training today Graham Scarbro is an active duty naval officer his views are his own and do not necessarily reflect the official views of the

Patrol Forces Southwest Asia was created at the request of U S Naval Forces Central Command in and has since gone about its business \u2014 supporting U S Navy requirements for maritime interdiction operations escort missions and force protection \u2014 essentially unchanged Meanwhile thousands of miles away in the Indo Pacific the U S Coast Guard lacks even a single operational vessel west of Guam despite the fact that it is the central theater for U S maritime strategy If the U S Department of Defense is serious about emerging from a period of strategic atrophy the U S Coast Guard\u2019s international posture should also change to reflect America\u2019s emphasis on great power competition Unfortunately legacy defense requirements are holding the Coast Guard back Current plans to commit a new generation of upgraded platforms to the less critical Central Command mission will serve only to lock in this resource fixation for the foreseeable future Rather than dedicate part of its recapitalizing force to yesteryear\u2019s strategy the U S Coast Guard should seize the opportunity to reorient itself creating a Patrol Forces Indo Pacific to address today\u2019s national objectives

in the Indo Pacific would add credibility to U S institutional commitments at a time when American security guarantees are being challenged across the region Time to Pass the Baton As former defense official Andrew Exum wrote earlier this year decades of U S capacity building efforts in the Middle East have failed to produce capabilities that benefit U S interests in the maritime domain This is not to say these efforts were misguided but building partner capacity depends on the will of partners to invest in and employ the capabilities and knowledge provided Gulf Cooperation Council members continue to build exquisite land and air forces at the expense of maritime capabilities thereby forcing the United States to shoulder the burden of securing waterways within the Arabian Gulf Withdrawal of U S Coast Guard forces from the region could spur those countries to greater action but this is a topic for another author The question at hand is whether Coast Guard investment in the Arabian Gulf serves national strategy more effectively than potential investment in the Indo Pacific The answer is unequivocally \u201cno \u201d The proposed shift toward the Indo Pacific and away from the Middle East is reinforced by the U S Coast Guard\u2019s own \u2013 Strategic Plan which calls on the service to \u201cstrategically orient time and resources toward international activities that maximize return on investment to national and Coast Guard priorities and foster international capacity building efforts in regions that are both critical to U S interests \u201d Reorienting its forces provides the Coast Guard with the opportunity to prioritize Indo Pacific partners making robust efforts to improve their maritime forces rather than continue to fill the Gulf Cooperation Council\u2019s operational gaps for another two decades What Might Patrol Forces Indo Pacific Look Like The Coast Guard\u2019s six foot Island class patrol boats currently operating in the Arabian Gulf are approaching the ends of their service lives Current procurement plans call for replacing these boats with at least four new foot Sentinel class fast response cutters Rather than commit new improved platforms to a less critical mission a small number of the Coast Guard\u2019s planned fast response cutters should form the nucleus of a strategically significant forward deployed Patrol Forces Indo Pacific The Coast Guard recently committed to basing three of these cutters in Guam within two to three years indicating that U S Coast Guard leadership is already looking for ways to maintain forces forward in the near term However when considering the size and scope of the Indo Pacific theater and the fact that current requirements in the Arabian Gulf call for six boats three cutters is only a good first step not a complete solution A robust force consisting of a mix of six fast response cutters the Coast Guard\u2019s new Heritage class offshore patrol cutters and perhaps a rotationally deployed national security cutter would be appropriately sized and ideally positioned to assume responsibility for security cooperation with Indo Pacific coast guards and navies seeking increased \u201cwhite hull\u201d interaction with the United States A U S Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment as well as an intelligence detachment could round out the proposed Patrol Forces Indo Pacific This would be consistent with previous overseas deployments that have seen these units based in or rotationally deployed to Bahrain in recent years The U S Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments\u2019 specialized security cooperation mission \u2014 training and deploying aboard partner maritime law enforcement vessels \u2014 is a sorely needed component in U S plans to build partners\u2019 capacity for independent constabulary operations at sea The detachments add further value through their capability to deploy aboard U S Navy ships Effectively using a warship as an expeditionary sea base for maritime law enforcement similar detachments have already proved invaluable within the Department of Defense\u2019s Oceania Maritime Security Initiative The addition of a U S Coast Guard intelligence detachment would serve a dual purpose In addition to supporting the proposed Patrol Forces Indo Pacific a Coast Guard intelligence unit could fulfill the National Defense Authorization Act requirement for a U S intelligence fusion center in the Indo Pacific without creating an unnecessary parallel structure alongside those already in existence What Could These Forces Accomplish A Coast Guard force with the ships proposed would offer operational endurance to operate across the entire Indo Pacific for months at a time and the bench depth to participate in capacity building exercises with a wide variety of established allies and new partners alike By including larger national security cutters as well as smaller craft the unit would be prepared for engagements with organizations ranging in size from small coast guards to high end navies The same overarching strategic guidance that directs the Coast Guard to reorient its time and resources also highlights China and Russia as primary challenges to the rules based international order As deployed the Coast Guard is not prepared to respond to these challenges or carry out the Coast Guard\u2019s regional commitments in the Indo Pacific which are discussed in greater detail below Were the Coast Guard to use the recapitalization of its cutter force as a pivot point it could bring two decades of international security cooperation experience to bear on the foremost challenges faced by the United States This pivot would also require buy in from the U S Department of Defense which would levy the requirement and provide funding for the new force However the potential return on investment for a U S Coast Guard squadron in the Indo Pacific is as great for U S Indo Pacific Command and the U S Navy as it is for the U S Coast Guard Bangladesh the Philippines Sri Lanka and Vietnam are all recipients of former U S cutters setting the stage for interoperability and cooperation at sea with the Coast Guard\u2019s new cutters all of which are also slated to receive communications and intelligence suites interoperable with U S Navy assets Creating a Coast Guard squadron capable of executing security cooperation engagements as well as operating in support of naval requirements would buttress partners\u2019 efforts to keep the seas free from coercion and illicit activity as well as provide critical support to the U S Navy\u2019s 7th Fleet Working in concert with a forward deployed Expeditionary Sea Base expected to arrive in the Indo Pacific in coming years a Patrol Forces Indo Pacific would be invaluable to the U S Indo Pacific Command both in peacetime and in periods of crisis In a July interview the commandant of the U S Coast Guard Adm Karl Schultz signaled his desire for the U S Coast Guard to \u201cbe a partner of choice\u201d in Oceania as well as to \u201cexpand U S Coast Guard permanent presence and effectiveness in the region through expeditionary capability \u201d In the same interview he introduced a new operating concept through Operation Aiga designed to bring a new mix of coast guard assets into the Pacific Islands region to accomplish those goals When asked about East and Southeast Asia Schultz highlighted the deployment of two Legend class national security cutters to the region and the aforementioned transfers of decommissioned coast guard cutters to partners in need but in discussing these high visibility deployments Schultz unintentionally highlighted that there is no permanent operation or in region force available to address security issues in East and Southeast Asia on a consistent basis While a focus on Oceania is by no means a problem a more robust presence with an established command framework and larger area of responsibility would offer far more to the broader Indo Pacific Investing in Partners When it comes to the coast guards and navies of the Indo Pacific most have far more in common with the U S Coast Guard than with the U S Navy As the former commander of Patrol Forces Southwest Asia once stated Most navies are not in the business of power projection They\u2019re in the business of enforcing sovereignty \u2026 Most other countries whether it\u2019s navy or coast guard are in the business of fisheries enforcement countersmuggling search and rescue \u2014 missions that very much dovetail with what the U S Coast Guard does Until now the U S Navy has done its best to address partners\u2019 non military needs in maritime security however the U S Coast Guard brings a mix of authorities to conduct both law enforcement and military functions that is uniquely suitable for these missions The Coast Guard\u2019s authorities combined with membership in the U S intelligence community make it the logical entity for sharing maritime law enforcement expertise with both military and constabulary agencies as well as providing specialized training required for missions such as interdiction of maritime traffickers fishing enforcement and environmental protection The Coast Guard\u2019s unique abilities across the spectrum of operations as stated by Schultz \u201cfrom security cooperation up to armed conflict \u201d only strengthen the case for creating a forward based Indo Pacific Coast Guard squadron For three years Pacific Area the U S Coast Guard\u2019s regional command element and force provider in the Pacific has deployed personnel to support high visibility security cooperation events during the U S Navy\u2019s Southeast Asia Cooperation and Training exercise These forces train navies and coast guards from across the Indo Pacific in skills including basic law enforcement and maritime interdiction operations both on land and at sea In Pacific Area deployed two of its premier cutters to the Indo Pacific The cutters deployed back to back conducted training with the navies and coast guards of U S allies and partners transited the Taiwan Strait and participated in North Korean sanctions enforcement patrols Partner nations like Australia Fiji Indonesia Malaysia and the Philippines were eager to work with the U S Coast Guard but insufficient funding and lack of in region forces mean that these gains in goodwill and cooperation could be lost if not sustained over the next budget year Building up a forward presence would take advantage of this momentum and seize the opportunity to bring key U S capabilities to bear before regional allies capitulate to Chinese pressure The addition of a U S Coast Guard squadron in the Indo Pacific also would provide U S Indo Pacific Command with an invaluable capability for use in countering Chinese maritime coercion in the region one of the key tenets in current U S Indo Pacific strategy The much vaunted Chinese \u201c cabbage strategy \u201d has stymied the U S and its partners over the course of the last decade Utilized when infringing upon sovereignty of regional states this strategy relies upon layered forces to blunt responses to aggressive Chinese maritime activities These forces consisting of a contact layer of civilian militia vessels backed by the white hulls of the China Coast Guard with the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy waiting in the wings over the horizon pose a complex threat that exceeds the capabilities of nearly all Indo Pacific states Thus China\u2019s coast guard thinks little of intimidating its smaller neighbors even when operating within their exclusive economic zones as few states are able to muster the appropriate forces or sufficient numbers to face this tripartite challenge This mix of maritime forces has even been employed effectively against U S Navy and naval auxiliary vessels in the South China Sea causing dangerous potentially escalatory incidents at sea on more than one occasion Introducing a robust Coast Guard force would provide the U S with options for responding to Chinese tactics while still operating below the threshold of military conflict Patrol Forces Indo Pacific would play a crucial role escorting independent deployers special mission vessels and others \u2014 providing critical defense in depth with less risk of escalation and without tying down scarce combatants in the \u201c oversubscribed \u201d U S 7th Fleet Basing Considerations Basing U S forces in the Indo Pacific is an admittedly delicate enterprise particularly as relations continue to chill between the United States and China However creating a Patrol Forces Indo Pacific offers an opportunity to forge new basing and deployment arrangements in the region evolving U S presence and access as called for in the Department of Defense\u2019s Indo Pacific Strategy Report The readily available though less evolutionary option for establishment of Patrol Forces Indo Pacific would expand upon plans to homeport three fast response cutters in Guam Construction of a cutter maintenance facility is already underway and Guam offers the considerable advantages of preexisting support and security infrastructure for U S forces Forces stationed in Guam would offer increased capacity to more traditional Department of Homeland Security missions but they would spend more time in transit than units based with a partner host nation In Southeast Asia Singapore already hosts a significant U S Navy presence as well as rotationally deployed ships This is not to say however that Singapore is the only option worth considering The U S Coast Guard\u2019s role as the lead element in the Southeast Asia Maritime Law Enforcement Initiative opens up other possibilities that would prove evolutionary in terms of U S access and presence Bringing together Cambodia Vietnam Thailand the Philippines Indonesia Malaysia and the United States this initiative provides training workshops and working groups focused on combating illicit maritime activity within the Gulf of Thailand and its surrounding areas As the initiative matures it might create opportunities for co locating U S personnel and patrol vessels with the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency or alongside Thai maritime law enforcement organizations in the Gulf of Thailand There are no ready made solutions to the challenge of finding the right host nation for such an endeavor but there are a number of possibilities worth investigating that fulfill partners\u2019 needs as well as further U S strategic interests in the theater Responsibility Without Resource As the U S representative to both the Southeast Asia Maritime Law Enforcement Initiative and the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia Pacific Area faces a perennial lack of dedicated resources and an ensuing yearly funding scramble to bring the Coast Guard forward into the Indo Pacific Shortfalls in Pacific Area operating funds are merely a subset of the broader issue of inadequate operations and readiness funding for the U S Coast Guard writ large as highlighted by its commandant and the service\u2019s Budget Overview A formalized forward based command with dedicated assets might serve to attract the requisite funding into the region that has heretofore lagged under the current organizational framework With that said both the service\u2019s recapitalization of its cutter fleet and its international engagements are at risk under current budgetary restrictions \u2014 an issue that merits its own article but it suffices here to say that the U S Coast Guard simply cannot do more with less What Is Dead May Never Die The pivot to the Pacific is dead The rebalance is dead Strategic defense priorities in the Indo Pacific are being overshadowed by a trade war and Iranian provocations in the Strait of Hormuz However the problem has not abated nor has its importance waned in the eyes of U S allies and partners Using the U S Coast Guard\u2019s recapitalization of its force as an opportunity to reallocate requirements and investment from the Arabian Gulf to the Indo Pacific is a meaningful way to emphasize U S commitment to its own National Defense Strategy Indo Pacific Strategy and U S Coast Guard Strategic Plan not to mention U S allies and partners Bolstering Coast Guard capabilities to meet the significant security cooperation challenges in its future is a key element in bringing all elements of U S power to bear in competing against a revisionist adversary in the Indo Pacific instead of relying on a navy that is both overtasked and ill suited for the job at hand As with all complex problems Patrol Forces Indo Pacific would not be a panacea but it is an opportunity to break the inertia of bureaucratic sunk costs in the Middle East and apply hard won skills and valuable assets to a key challenge in the Indo Pacific Blake Herzinger BDHerzinger

breathing diesel engines and nuclear powered submarines that could quietly hum along under the sea at relatively high speeds for months at a time thanks to their nuclear reactors The downside to the nuclear powered variety of course is that they cost many times the price of a comparable diesel submarines and require nuclear propulsion technology which may not be worth the trouble for a country only interested in defending its coastal waters A diesel submarine may also run more quietly than a nuclear submarine by turning off its engines and running on batteries\u2014but only for a very short amount of time Still there remains a performance gap in stealth and endurance that many countries would like to bridge at an affordable price One such country was Sweden which happens to be in a busy

Might Kill Russia\u2019s New Stealth Fighter Back in the 1960s Sweden had begun developing a modernized version of the Stirling engine a closed cycle heat conversion engine first developed in This was first used to power a car in the 1970s then the Swedish ship builder Kockums successfully retrofitted a Stirling engine to power a Swedish Navy A14 submarine Nacken in Because the Stirling burns diesel fuel using liquid oxygen stored in cryogenic tanks rather than an air breathing engine it can quietly cruise underwater at low speeds for weeks at a time without having to surface Kockums went on to build three Gotland class submarines in the late 1990s the first operational submarines designed with Air Independent Propulsion systems The Gotland became famous for sinking a U S aircraft carrier in a military exercise its characteristics and operational history are further described in this earlier article Stirling AIP technology has subsequently been incorporated into numerous Japanese and Chinese submarines while Germany and France developed more expensive fuel cell and steam turbine based AIP submarines instead Sweden meanwhile converted her four late 80s vintage V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland diesel electric submarines between and to use Stirling AIP engines\u2014refits which involved cutting the submarines in two and stretching them out from forty eight to sixty meters Two of these submarines were re designated the S\u00f6dermanland class while the other two were sold to Singapore The latter Archer class boats are climatized for operations in warmer waters and boast improved navigation and fire control systems Enter the A26 Sweden\u2019s Ghostly Super Sub of the Future\u2014On Paper Sweden intends to retire its S\u00f6dermanland boats between and Since the 1990s Kockums had been bouncing around a concept for a next generation AIP submarine designated the A26 to succeed the Gotland class but encountered numerous setbacks Stockholm canceled A26 procurement in and at one point there was even a raid by the Swedish government attempting to confiscate blueprints from the German parent firm Thyssen Krupp which was confronted by company security Since then Kockums has been purchased by the Swedish firm Saab Finally in June Swedish defense minister Sten Tolgfors announced Stockholm was finally committing to procure two A26s at a price equivalent to million\u2014less than a fifth the unit cost of a nuclear powered Virginia class submarine of the U S Navy The A26 has also been marketed abroad at various times to Australia India the Netherlands Norway and Poland but so far without success due to competition from French and German AIP submarine makers and an apparent reluctance from smaller European states to commit to submarine purchases at this time Kockums claims the A26 will achieve new levels of acoustic stealth thanks to a new \u2018GHOST\u2019 Genuine Holistic Stealth technology which involves acoustic damping plates flexible rubber mountings for hardware a less reflective hull with a lower target strength and degaussing to lower the submarine\u2019s magnetic signature Supposedly the A26\u2019s hull will also be unusually resilient to underwater explosions The Swedish firm has unveiled concept art depicting a submarine with a \u2018chinned\u2019 sail X shaped tail fins for greater maneuverability in rocky Baltic waters and four millimeter torpedo tubes can fire both heavyweight torpedoes back up by two millimeter tubes all of which would use wire guided torpedoes The vessel\u2019s four Stirling engines apparently allow allowing for higher sustainable underwater cruising speed of to knots Kockums has emphasized the new designs\u2019 modularity which should lower development costs for specialized variants such as one configuration accommodating up to eighteen Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles in a vertical launch system This is a feature likely meant to appeal to Warsaw which would like cruise missile equipped submarines Another important features is a special \u2018multi mission\u2019 portal for deploying special forces and underwater vehicles a much in demand feature for

\u2018medium\u2019 model intended for Swedish service would measure meters long and displace roughly tons surfaced It would typically have a crew of around twenty six and a maximum endurance of forty five days including eighteen to thirty days sources differ submerged generally sustaining a speed of knots This endurance including a typical range of miles should give it capability for operations in the Atlantic Ocean\u2014in contrast to the Gotlands which are not designed for transoceanic deployments There is also a smaller meter \u2018Pelagic\u2019 version for short range patrols and an Extended Range model stretched to eighty meters long and displacing tons that might appeal to operators in the Pacific Ocean due to its mile range and day endurance Sweden\u2019s two A26s should be

longer instructional film entitled How To Behave In Britain and while some of the lessons remain timely other aspects don t hold up \u2014 like when Burgess refers to a black soldier as a \u201ccolored boy \u201d and visibly ties himself into knots explaining to viewers that the Brits in are a lot less racist than most Americans at the time VIDEO WW2 Training Film for US Soldiers How to Behave in Britain youtu be In a later portion of the film Burgess and a fellow soldier who is black exit a train at which point an elderly British woman who is white stops the two men and thanks them inviting the black soldier to tea It s at this point that Burgess turns back to the camera and with a furtive look to his left and right explains to viewers that this sort of interaction \u201cmight not happen at home \u201d where African Americans were still subjected to legalized racism and segregation under Jim Crow laws \u201cNow look men you heard that conversation that s not unusual here \u201d Burgess says \u201cIt s the sort of thing that happens quite a lot \u201d \u201cNow let s be frank about it there are colored soldiers as well as white here and there are less social restrictions in this country An English woman asking a colored boy to tea he was polite about it and she was polite about it Now that might not happen at home but the point is we re not at home and the point is too if we bring a lot of prejudices here what are we going to do about them \u201d Few things are as sure to ruin that warm fuzzy feeling you had watching the scene in the pub like the ugly truth that white soldiers had to be reminded not to be too racist abroad The subtext of the video is obvious though delivered without a sense of irony save that bigotry for back in the States once we ve finished defending the world against fascism and tyranny It s too bad we can t divorce How To Behave In A British Pub from the feature length training video with its silly and lighthearted tips for how to not be a schmuck at a bar or the hilarious cameo by comedian Bob Hope who shows up to steal Burgess money But like history itself we can t \u2014 or rather we shouldn t \u2014 cherry

strategy around the world dating as far back as ancient Egyptian times It\u2019s a key part of Sun Tzu\u2019s The Art of War Technology has made methods of deception more sophisticated of course but the basic premise has stood the test of time know yourself deceive your enemy Armed forces the world over have used this strategy and civilian industries have a real opportunity to learn from the successes of the military when it comes to deception technology Highlights from the history of military deception Examples of military deception are present in the ancient dynasties of China and Egypt Sun Tzu\u2019s famous book dates back to about the 5th century BC The Carthaginian general Hannibal considered one of the best military commanders of all time used deception tactics extensively And of course everyone is familiar with one of the most successful deceptions of all time the Trojan horse George Washington used deception repeatedly including a ruse that allowed him to evacuate soldiers from what seemed like a hopeless position Following a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Brooklyn the soldiers were pinned against the East River Using all available flatboats and aided by heavy fog Washington was able to evacuate all troops to Manhattan without detection Campfires left burning helped with the deception And later in American history the Civil War saw the construction of a fake ironclad warship that sent Confederate forces fleeing Deception also abounded in World War II as when British forces in North Africa built a dummy railhead to protect the real railhead some distance away The Soviets used a variety of deception tactics to install missiles in Cuba The element of surprise is one of the most valuable commodities in battle and deception has provided it time and again making it a favourite tactic throughout history and to this day Bringing deception technology to the masses Deception technology has a lot to offer to non military organisations and there is a lot to learn from deception\u2019s successful track record in the military The many benefits of deception include Organisations can steer away the biggest risk they have \u2013 the risk of high impact cyberattacks the type of attacks that can bring a company down Cost savings through the reduction of false positive alerts and dramatic reductions in incident response time Security operations centre SOC efficiency is top of mind today with floods of new alerts straining already overworked security teams Modern distributed deception platforms produce only high fidelity notifications meaning less time wasted chasing false alarms and less time required to research each incident More efficient SOC processes mean less burnout and turnover alleviating the security skills gap Deception can help with both due diligence and integration when it comes to mergers and acquisitions M A \u2013 assessing the attack surface is a critical step When Verizon bought Yahoo the discovery of a security breach reduced the acquisition price by million From assessing the attack surface in the due diligence phase to both assessing and detecting attackers in the integration phase deception technology helps the acquiring company better understand their risk and the attack surface they will be responsible for going forward Growing adoption The deception market is evolving rapidly with most analysts now actively promoting deception technology and major global firms rolling out deception across their estates However two areas of confusion often still raise their heads The first is that people tend to conflate honeypots and distributed deception The two are not synonymous Honeypots \u2013 now properly referred to as Fully Interactive Decoys or simply Decoys \u2013 are a form of deception Decoys have a role in threat intelligence gathering but are not useful in detecting diverting or stopping attacks Those who have learned about Honeypots in the past do themselves a disservice in thinking this limited use technology represents the current state of the art of deception Distributed endpoint deceptions \u2013 tiny inert data elements broadly spread throughout the environment \u2013 offer the fastest earliest and most reliable attack detection mechanism available today Environments protected by this easy to deploy simple to operate approach are virtually invulnerable to successful attacks The second area of confusion is the misbelief that deception is somehow sophisticated or complex For organisations that barely have mastered cybersecurity basics deception may sound advanced However advances in automation and machine learning have removed the challenges of deploying and maintaining highly authentic deception technology Today\u2019s platforms install refresh and operate almost hands free and are being effectively managed by security teams as small as two employees as effectively as those with Best practices for implementing deception technology successfully Be very clear about what use cases you\u2019re trying to solve Establish clear objectives and evaluate and implement accordingly Understand your organisation\u2019s culture of change While the ease and simplicity of today\u2019s deception technology allows for near instant estate wide deployment some organisations take more of a phased approach They may start with specific threat vectors For instance generally conservative large banks might deploy deception only around their SWIFT environment and based on success there expand deception to the rest of the organisation over time Understanding yourself is first key to Sun Tzu\u2019s deception strategy I will force the enemy to take our strength for weakness and our weakness for strength and thus will turn his strength into weakness Unfortunately many organisations don\u2019t have adequate visibility into their own strengths and weaknesses As you begin your deception implementation the first step is to understand your attack surface where might the attacker find weakness Do you have exposed domain credentials What pathways exist in your organisation that lead an attacker to your crown jewels How can these be reduced Plan for success Deception is an effective and fundamental military tool It\u2019s been practiced at least since ancient China and is still heavily used today because if implemented properly it works Deception provides a proactive stance that lets you get ahead of the game Rather than reacting to an attack you are the one defining what happens not the opponent Ofer Israeli founder and CEO

every year to take part in two phase exercises comprising live fire and tactical effects simulation TES and engagement with a live enemy In one area of the base a line of more than crosses serve as a stark reminder of the deaths that occurred during training \u2013 the majority from road accidents \u2013 since the army\u2019s arrival at BATUS nearly years ago For the armed forces cc and is essential to properly prepare personnel for combat The reasoning is simple the more realistic and well managed the training in advance of deployment the fewer the likely casualties during operations In the context of the number of military personnel \u2013 there were around million on active duty in the US in plus reservists \u2013 fatalities during training while tragic are mercifully rare However how best to protect forces during training and simulation exercises remains a subject of perennial debate In May lawmakers on the US House Armed Service Committee revealed that in nearly four times as many personnel died in training accidents as were killed during combat According to statistics obtained by the Washington Examiner US Army soldiers died in training accidents in while another were seriously injured In the UK a BBC investigation recently found that the MOD breached health and safety laws in training times in the past years Pushed to the limit the risks associated with military training The British MOD\u2019s report \u2018 Training and exercise deaths in the UK Armed Forces \u2019 published in March and covering the period from January to February makes for sobering reading Of the recorded deaths which account for of all UK regular armed forces personnel and \u2018on duty\u2019 reservist fatalities during that period were in the army with the biggest cause being disease related conditions The navy suffered fatalities with diving or snorkelling incidents accounting for the most deaths Of the deaths in the RAF aircraft accidents were responsible for more than half The risk to personnel posed by disease made headlines last November when two recruits \u2013 one from Ghana and the other from Malawi \u2013 collapsed and died during military exercise runs at Whittington Barracks in Staffordshire Both had undiagnosed sickle cell disease a condition that affects around people in the UK and is more common in people of African or Caribbean descent \u201cA senior coroner ruled that training and planning that day was poor and that the men who died had been neglected by the army \u201d According to the MOD candidates will now be screened for the trait \u2018where available\u2019 via an NHS family questionnaire while \u2018work is under way\u2019 to introduce blood tests for candidates \u2018whose family background suggests they might be at a higher

ruled that training and planning that day was poor and that the men who died had been neglected by the army which said it would do \u2018everything possible to prevent a recurrence\u2019 of the deaths The following year Corporal Joshua Hoole collapsed and died during an annual fitness test near Brecon and in Lance Corporal George Partridge died at the National Diving and Activity Centre near

the impetus for my project \u2013 inviting people to use whatever they had at home to make their own comfort blanket What could people make not just out of their scrap materials but also out of this moment and the limitations it brings People have been really creative One woman whose husband passed away is making her blanket out of his old clothes I talked to somebody who is a real globetrotter

the most valuable currency of our time is hope Once coronavirus started to happen I thought it\u2019s really important that we continue this now I\u2019m normally a sceptical person but the fact my

done and some will come as we complete the choreography This particular piece is trying to create that brotherhood feeling The current situation might amplify those emotions once we go back to the theatre The power of being a thousand people in a venue experiencing something together on a cellular level a chemical level \u2013 not on a screen but sensing the air After being isolated I hope we

community of singers some professional some not and created in collaboration with shamanic practitioners those who have retained a respect for nature through ancient ritual but recognise that these rituals too need to be remade so that we all can find a way in to this kind of connection to nature to Earth and to each other I don\u2019t know if this work will ever be made but the impulse to

need to be together and movies have to be about something that creates debate and laughter and sadness in a way that\u2019s both profound and entertaining to be discussed and shared as a group If we ever get the privilege to make a film again I hope we are aware of that responsibility of an audience\u2019s need to be liberated from their isolation Laughing together \u2026 Love Love Love by Mike Bartlett at Lyric Hammersmith Photograph Tristram Kenton The Guardian Rachel O\u2019Riordan artistic director of Lyric Hammersmith It was four days after press night that we had to close Love Love Love a satirical drama directed by O\u2019Riordan I\u2019d like to finish its run and convey the message that the show can and will go on We won\u2019t be the same people but I want to convey the message that this was a pause not an end The Lyric was originally a music hall People went to music halls during the war to laugh In trauma we need to be together and have a release And we can\u2019t at the moment Laughing together again sitting side by side will be a very powerful thing Antigone directed by Roy Alexander Weise and part of the same season of productions was in its first day of rehearsals when I had to tell the company we were closing The Sophoclean drama is all about a world that has been decimated and has to start to rebuild itself We were working on the translation by Seamus Heaney who lived through the Troubles and was profoundly affected by the suffering he saw I feel that when we programme it again it will be playing to audiences who live in a world that is also trying to rebuild itself emotionally and economically It will have added intensity", "page_url":

installation to installation to decide when training will resume again We are taking a hard look at how we get back to collective training both at home station and our combat training centers Army Chief of Staff Gen James McConville said today during a Pentagon briefing Getting back to collective training is crucial but we need to make sure we have the right measures in place first It s not going to be a one size fits all solution The Army has proposed a risk mitigation framework to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper so that we can safely return to training Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy said during the briefing Related Here s How the Army Is Planning to Restart Training for Large Combat Units The virus did not impact the country uniformly so we need to tailor our approach to the reopening by developing Army wide standards and protocols McCarthy said The Army halted rotations to the National Training Center at Fort Irwin California and the Joint Readiness Training Center in Fort Polk Louisiana in mid March to limit the spread of the virus NTC JRTC and Joint Multinational Readiness Center at Hohenfels Germany hold brigade level training exercises for armor infantry and Stryker brigade combat teams and are a key measurement for the service s combat readiness So far four BCTs have had their combat training center or CTC rotations postponed a senior Army official told Military com We were able to look into the future and decide we could delay their rotation until a later date the senior official said CTC rotations are important because it s a deployment of a force to a combat training center a redeployment of that force back its home station but it s also a force on force exercise the official said While those are important there is a whole host of training that goes on at our home stations that has to happen in places like Fort Campbell Kentucky before you go to those combat training centers The framework is being designed so commanders can make training decisions based on their capacity for testing treatment and monitoring as well as the trends in COVID cases in their area of the country the official said It will depend on the amount of testing capability and capacity that they have at that installation to say listen this battalion is going to the field for two weeks they are probably going to want to test that entire battalion before they go to the field the official said If the local rate is really bad then they probably need to do more testing but if the local rate is better then maybe they don t need to do as much testing The Army recently announced upcoming deployments for several units including some that will begin this summer The 4th Security Forces Assistance Brigade stationed at Fort Carson Colorado is set to deploy to Afghanistan And the 2nd BCT of the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg North Carolina is slated to deploy to Iraq The 4th SFAB is currently scheduled to conduct its rotation to the Joint Readiness Training Center in June Army officials maintain McConville said he just visited the Joint Readiness Training Center to look at the measures being put into place to receive units We are applying screening testing controlled monitoring and tactical dispersion to create safety bubbles so units can train and operate in a protected environment he said We are looking at the long game We are not waiting for COVID to go away We are putting the right procedures in place so we can protect the force that will train and operate under a COVID environment Despite the impacts of the virus Army officials said that units have displayed high levels of readiness in the last four months At the beginning of the new year paratroopers conducted an emergency deployment to the Middle East as

technology that can destroy hazardous chemical compounds in groundwater that are contaminating military bases surrounding communities and the environment The service this week announced it had tested an Enhanced Contact Plasma Reactor capable of destroying perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid known as PFOS and PFOA synthetic chemical compounds that are collectively part of a group of polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS Tested at Wright Patterson Air Force Base Ohio with partners Clarkson University and GSI Environmental as well as the Air Force Civil Engineer Center the reactor acts as a closed system utilizing water electricity and argon gas to degrade PFOS and PFOA in minutes the service said in a news release The argon gas concentrates PFAS at the gas liquid interface and plasma is generated at that interface which then destroys PFAS said Dr Selma Mededovic one of the principal researchers and an associate professor at Clarkson s Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Related List of Bases Contaminated with PFAS Chemicals Expected to Grow Pentagon Says The scientists said plasma can reduce the PFAS molecule chain down into smaller compounds through several repeated cycles Hundreds of gallons of groundwater were treated during a two week demonstration according to the release This is the only technology that actually destroys PFAS molecules that has been demonstrated at this scale it doesn t just remove them from water added Clarkson s Dr Tom Holsen also a principal researcher in the release All of the other demonstrations that we re aware of remove it from the water through filtration so there is still a PFAS containing waste The Sept test comes amid Pentagon efforts to find solutions to treat the contamination which has been linked to birth defects infertility developmental delays and some cancers At the direction of Defense Secretary Mark Esper in July the Pentagon established a task force to study the chemicals which have been found in aqueous firefighting foam in use by the military since the 1970s The foam containing PFAS has since been mostly phased out but is still used on some Navy ships The analysts will next conduct a more detailed analysis of the treated water and evaluate further scaling up of their plasma reactor design The method could have broader applications beyond military bases and may become a commercialized product in the next two years Mededovic told Military com We were just recently awarded the Environmental Protection Agency s Small Business Innovation Research Phase II grant to commercialize the system she said Tuesday in an email We are currently also looking into using our plasma based treatment system to treat ion exchange regenerant brine combining plasma with ion exchange foam fractionate combining plasma with foam fractionation landfill leachate and aqueous film forming foams formulations PFAS chemicals have been found in the drinking water of locations where million Americans reside in states The Defense Department in began widespread testing for contamination in drinking water at its facilities Last year the DoD examined installations for PFOS and PFOA and found with some level of contamination Twenty four of those had drinking water contamination at levels higher than the EPA s lifetime health advisory standard of parts per trillion The chemicals are also found in many industrial and consumer products such as food packaging nonstick cookware stain and water resistant fabric and carpet polishes and paints Patricia Kime contributed to this

assisting with the response Although television has conditioned many of us to equate the presence of soldiers with \u201cmartial law \u201d the reality is that military support during a pandemic is far more likely to come in the form of medical care transportation construction equipment and supplies In this article I\u2019ll address two of the topics that often accompany increased military support during emergency responses quarantines and the Posse Comitatus Act I also provide a list of questions that public safety professionals can use to alleviate some of their anxiety and confidently synchronize their public safety efforts with any military response Military Support to Quarantines Soldiers walk through a treatment area at the site of a military field hospital Sunday April in Seattle The facility which will be used for people with medical issues that are not related to the coronavirus outbreak has more than beds AP Photo Ted S Warren The federal government\u2019s quarantine and isolation authorities are administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and are primarily aimed at the protection of national borders interstate travel and federal property The military can support these efforts but it is more likely you will see U S Customs Border Protection U S Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the United States Coast Guard carrying out these missions At the local level even during national pandemics quarantine and isolation efforts will primarily fall to local governments operating under state law State and local personnel including state controlled National Guard remain the primary response with the federal government preferring to play a supporting role If states do request federal support the active duty military is just one potential source of assistance If the military is tasked with these missions they will carefully plan their operations to minimize unnecessary confrontations between military personnel and civilians Out of respect for state sovereignty the military provides domestic support under a \u201clast in\u201d and \u201cfirst out\u201d approach allowing it to quickly remove its presence once the mission has been accomplished Even with the military\u2019s commitment to states\u2019 rights any increase in a local military presence can certainly raise anxiety levels and prompt discussions about the Posse Comitatus Act and the military\u2019s long standing practice of avoiding civilian affairs Posse Comitatus Act The Posse Comitatus Act PCA was originally intended to end the use of federal troops in state elections during the reconstruction era It has since come to represent the federal government\u2019s reluctance to use the military in executing civil laws Generally the PCA prevents the direct participation of the active duty military in a search seizure arrest or similar activity The often repeated shorthand is \u201cthe military can\u2019t arrest civilians \u201d and in large part that is true \u2013 but only when the arrest is done for the primary purpose of helping civilian law enforcement Where the arrest was done for a \u201cmilitary purpose \u201d the PCA simply doesn\u2019t apply While there are dozens of legislative and court recognized exceptions to the PCA this \u201cmilitary purpose\u201d doctrine continues to provide the most confusion Military Purpose Doctrine Since the PCA was intended to prevent military involvement in civilian affairs nothing in the Act or its implementing regulations keeps the military from performing military functions \u2013 even where those functions may result in direct \u201c law enforcement type \u201d activities This means regardless of the ultimate mission if the military has developed security measures for the protection of military personnel property and functions those measures will be legally enforceable against all persons including civilians In its simplest terms the PCA does not require the military to stand by and watch as civilians steal their medical supplies Military Purpose Limitations Although the PCA doesn\u2019t prohibit direct law enforcement type activities when conducted primarily for a military purpose constitutional rights still apply to these activities including any searches seizures or use of force Military operations taking place in the U S are planned with military attorneys specializing in Domestic Operational Law These attorneys are experts at anticipating military security and enforcement activities and keeping those activities closely related to their underlying military purpose Activity that is overly broad and only indirectly or marginally related to the mission may result in a violation of the PCA For that reason domestic operations are ideally planned to avoid even the appearance of assisting civilian law enforcement executing civilian law or intruding into civilian affairs \u2013 unless of course specific statutes authorize such support Public Safety Coordination with Military Operations Military officials operating under the National Incident Management System NIMS know the importance of aligning their command and control communications resources and authorities with state and local responses As part of this alignment military planners will work with public safety liaisons before deploying into a civilian jurisdiction Ideally these

are the military authorities and limitations associated with the mission What security activity and area are related to the mission Specify whether this will involve static security foot patrols mobile patrols and how their personnel will be identified What steps have been taken to minimize the chance of confrontation between military personnel and civilians Limited area of patrols Signage Barriers What are the command policies for detention emergency response driving pursuit and surveillance What is the express military purpose of any security activity Protect military or federal property or personnel Ensure the accomplishment of a military mission What direct support to civilian law enforcement can the units provide What support is prohibited Are there overlapping areas where accomplishing the military mission will have an incidental benefit to civilian law enforcement Can you plan for the incidental benefit What methods of communication and information sharing will be used Can local civilian agencies request the use of military patrols Who will control the military units Are there any military assets that can be shared with local law enforcement What are the military \u201crules for use of force\u201d \u201cMission RUF\u201d and arming status What intermediate force options will the military have available How do these compare to local use of force policies Although there are certainly more questions that you\u2019d like answered as you prepare for military support knowing the answers to the above security related questions can help inform public information briefings deconflict emergency operations and reduce the anxiety that can accompany an increased military presence in your communities References Although the United States Coast

the Su \u201cFLANKER\u201d family in the numbers originally envisaged Created under the Future Combat Aircraft PAK FA programme the Su is being considered for two operational scenarios Under the first it will replace the Su 35S when needed as the existing FLANKERS currently suit the Russian Aerospace Forces because unless there is a change in circumstances dogfights between the Su 57s and western fifth generation fighters such as the F22 RAPTOR and F35 LIGHTNING II are not expected in the near future Under the second scenario the Su could be purchased in small quantities to operate at high speeds and altitudes destroying enemy radars and protecting friendly aircraft with long range missiles High performance and modern armament With two AL 41F turbojet engines it has a top speed of about kph and a range of km in addition to the ability to climb metres per minute Unlike the MiG 31BM interceptor which is very fast but not very manoeuvrable the Su is capable in both respects The aircraft\u2019s weaponry is located inside the inner fuselage compartments but if necessary weapons can be carried externally These include the X anti radar missile and the new long range RVV BD which can prosecute targets at 600km While their American counterparts \u2013 the upgraded AGM and AIM missiles \u2013 are perhaps more advanced in terms of guidance they cannot cover such distances The reported targets of the Su in this role would include reconnaissance aircraft heavy drones AWACS aircraft and air to air refuelling tankers while for the Su to engage important ground targets a small

article contains several misconceptions and some out of date information that deserves to be addressed Let\u2019s go through his arguments section by section Will WireGuard replace my IPsec site to site VPN Tremer writes No There is no chance the big vendors \u2026 will pick up WireGuard They do not jump onto trains like this unless there is a big necessity When he says this Tremer is talking about commercial VPN hardware software vendors who mostly use a centralized hub and spoke architecture Although it\u2019s true that most IPsec VPN vendors are unlikely to upgrade to WireGuard users we hear from are only rarely trying to make their existing VPN concentrators work with a new protocol Instead they are eager to replace their bottlenecked VPN concentrators with something more lightweight and less restrictive WireGuard replaces your VPN hardware with a simple software solution so it doesn\u2019t need support from your legacy hardware vendor Will WireGuard replace my road warrior from laptop to data center Tremer writes Right now WireGuard has a huge backlog of features that it needs to implement to be suitable for this use case It does not for example allow using a dynamic IP address on the server side of the tunnel which breaks a whole use case The article claims WireGuard is missing a \u201chuge backlog of features \u201d but only lists dynamic IP addresses as a missing feature The \u201chuge backlog\u201d may be out of date information from earlier WireGuard versions This section of the article is confusing at first because it talks about \u201croad warrior\u201d users who generally have dynamic IP addresses not being supported by WireGuard But this is not true standard WireGuard happily works as long as at least one end usually the central VPN concentrator has a static IP address The rest of the section appears to be discussing the problems caused by both ends of a connection having dynamic IP addresses for example so you can get to an office network whose home connection uses dynamic DNS It\u2019s true that plain WireGuard does not support this configuration out of the box However there are various scripts and higher level tools including ours that make this work fine Update A few people responded that WireGuard does work fine even if both ends are on dynamic IP addresses This is not true out of the box You can configure a WireGuard client to point at a server\u2019s DNS name and that DNS name can be updated periodically using dynamic DNS However the standard WireGuard software only resolves the DNS name once at startup so if the server hops to a new address you will need to restart each client\u2019s WireGuard instance before it looks up the DNS name again Various tools and scripts exist to automate this process for both WireGuard and IPsec Tailscale resolves this issue too but in a different way So it is easy to use then Tremer writes Is IPsec really hard to use No it clearly is not if the vendor has done their homework right and provides an interface that is easy to use In this section Tremer argues that IPsec is not very hard to use after all \u2014 in contradiction to the experiences of most readers \u2014 and points out that you only need to specify your own public IP address the public IP of your peer the subnets you want to make available for each side and a pre shared key After that the VPN \u201cis compatible with every vendor out there \u201d This is a surprising set of claims First of all that is not the only information needed to configure IPsec critically correct use of IPsec requires you to specify exactly which cipher suites you want to allow This is an unanswerable question for anyone who is not a cryptography expert The defaults are virtually never secure or cross platform The selection of cipher suites affects which IPsec vendors are compatible with each other Far from a VPN that \u201cis compatible with every vendor out there \u201d the default settings for one vendor almost never work with hardware and software from another vendor Secondly he suggests that it is necessary to specify public IP addresses for both ends of the tunnel This is mysterious given that in the previous section he incorrectly claimed WireGuard requires exactly that and thus would not work with dynamic IPs In truth both IPsec and WireGuard work fine with only one end on a well defined IP so in both cases you only need to configure at most one public IP address Finally he suggests using a pre shared key PSK on both ends PSKs are one of the weakest forms of authentication Passwords are one form of PSK Among other things a key stolen from one node makes it possible to impersonate either end and forge traffic from both ends Both IPsec and WireGuard allow public key authentication which is considerably stronger but only WireGuard makes it mandatory We\u2019ll talk about the security dangers of IPsec\u2019s \u201cflexibility\u201d below Everyone who has ever tried to create an IPsec tunnel to an OpenBSD machine can probably tell a tale of that The author here seems to suggest that configuring IPsec on OpenBSD is complicated Although our team is not personally familiar with IPsec on OpenBSD we do know that configuring WireGuard on OpenBSD is easy just like on other platforms On Protocol Complexity Worryingly Tremer states The end user does not have to worry about the complexity of the protocol If that was an issue we would have definitely gone rid of SIP and H FTP and other protocols that don\u2019t cope well with NAT and are decades old Complexity in some protocols can be acceptable although never desirable But in security it is deadly From a paper by N Ferguson and B Schneier In our opinion IPsec is too complex to be secure The design obviously tries to support many different situations with different options We feel very strongly that the resulting system is well beyond the level of complexity that can be analysed or properly implemented with current methodologies Thus no IPsec system will achieve the goal of providing a high level of security That paper is more than years old and IPsec has only increased in complexity It remains nearly impossible to analyze In it is well understood that IPsec\u2019s excessive complexity puts it on the verge of obsolescence now that better options are available These problems are some of the reason for the strong shift toward TLS instead of IPsec in the decades since IPsec was standardized Tremer also says User authentication using username password or a SIM card with EAP \u2026 WireGuard does not have that This statement remains true of core WireGuard However WireGuard is a data plane it is intended to be used with a key exchange mechanism built on top and there are several available for use in different situations Tailscale provides one such key exchange mechanism using Oauth2 OIDC or SAML to connect to your preferred identity provider Compared to IPsec\u2019s very complex key negotiation protocols it is much easier to analyze and audit the security of WireGuard and then audit a separate key exchange mechanism on top On Ignoring Real World Problems Next Tremer criticizes the \u201copinionated\u201d cryptographic design of WireGuard it only allows a single cipher suite If you were to change the cipher you are using from one day to the next one you would need to upgrade your WireGuard software on all those laptops phones etc at the same time This statement is simply false Someday WireGuard will need to be upgraded to support a second cipher suite When this happens users will be able to configure it peer by peer to allow one cipher suite or the other or both exactly as they would with any other VPN Most VPNs and TLS offer thousands of different possible combinations of algorithms to choose from \u2014 most of which are insecure or slow or both In contrast a hypothetical WireGuard protocol v2 can offer just two suites the old one and the new one with simple advice use the new one if you can and allow the old one for old nodes until they\u2019re upgraded There\u2019s nothing unusual about this except you don\u2019t need to be a cryptography expert to configure it Cryptography Tremer continues his claim that more crypto algorithms makes IPsec just as good as WireGuard I would conclude that practically the same cryptography is available for all VPNs here Therefore WireGuard is not more or less secure than the others when it comes to encryption or data integrity On the surface this claim is true you can assemble a cipher suite for IPsec that is roughly the same as the only cipher suite used in WireGuard However this leaves out some important details First of all you have to learn how to choose and configure the right IPsec cipher suite which only a skilled cryptographer should ever be trusted to do And second once you attempt to use that cipher suite you will likely find that it\u2019s not compatible with virtually any VPN hardware or software you can find Ironically although the IPsec standard allows virtually every cipher suite it does not mandate any of them Two nodes can be completely IPsec compliant and yet completely unable to talk to each other and it\u2019s your job to figure out why With WireGuard there is only one cipher suite so you don\u2019t need a degree in cryptography to choose it Someday there will likely be a second suite available Unlike IPsec it\u2019s trivial to confirm whether two WireGuard capable software packages should be able to talk to each other Is WireGuard faster than other VPN solutions In this section Tremer makes several hand wavy arguments and no benchmarks that because of how CPUs have evolved AES encryption will probably be faster than ChaCha20 Without identifying a particular platform and language to test on it is unclear whether this claim is technically correct or not What matters though is for almost all use cases both IPsec and WireGuard are perfectly fine The symmetric encryption you use AES or ChaCha20 or anything else is almost never relevant at all except on extremely fast well over Gbit sec networks One exception is legacy VPN concentrator hardware which tends to be built on relatively slow processors that bog down with too many IPsec users at once But this is not really a fault of IPsec itself Mobile processors are somewhat slower than desktop and server processors when doing encryption of course but they are also usually on much slower networks On mobile you should expect the symmetric crypto to take maybe of the time and slow networks to take of the time Some non IPsec and non WireGuard VPN platforms carry their traffic over TCP Most \u201cSSL VPNs\u201d and \u201cBeyondCorp proxies\u201d are in this category Carrying VPN traffic over TCP is quirky and can cause slowdowns and lag with real time traffic such as VoIP video calls and remote desktops But neither IPsec nor WireGuard has this problem Another issue to watch out for is point to multipoint versus hub and spoke VPN architecture In general a hub and spoke architecture introduces higher latency due to extra hops IPsec was originally intended to support point to multipoint architecture but due to some major design flaws this is almost never attempted in practice When configured correctly WireGuard is capable of operating securely in point to multipoint mode and reducing latency For example a WireGuard enabled laptop can have open connections directly to three datacenters simultaneously instead of to one datacenter that then has tunnels to other datacenters Issues integrating into Linux This section of Tremer\u2019s article has become obsolete Since his article was written WireGuard has been accepted into the Linux kernel and the authors have released WireGuard\u2019s stable version What does the real world look like In his conclusion Tremer says Unfortunately every time when a customer asks me to help them setting up a VPN the credentials that they are getting are using old ciphers 3DES in combination with MD5 is a common candidate as well as AES with SHA1 Although the latter is better it is still not what I would like to use today Tremer is of course talking about his own customers Those customers seem to be trying to configure new software that will talk to legacy IPsec VPN servers that were configured probably years ago to require obsolete and increasingly insecure cipher suites If that\u2019s what you need to do you have no choice use the best IPsec software available to talk to your legacy systems The long term option is to reconsider why you need that legacy VPN concentrator in the first place WireGuard is open source can run in a pure software virtual machine so avoids hardware lock in and bottlenecks supports only a single cipher suite which is known to be very fast and very secure and will work with whatever key exchange mechanism you want to layer on top It is increasingly widely accepted as the future of secure VPN connectivity", "page_url": "https://tailscale.com/blog/why-not-why-not-wireguard/", "label": 1, "score": "210705_news_164979"},

Thursday The connectors will replace the aging fleet of Landing Craft Air Cushion vehicles known as LCACs which have been in operation since the 1980s and are nearing the end of their service lives The new footlong connectors will have further range and lift capabilities than the legacy LCACs They can carry tons and will be compatible with amphibious ships that have well decks along with expeditionary transfer dock and sea bases As the program continues to move forward with delivering these important capabilities to the fleet the procurement of these additional craft is critical Tom

reclusive country said The new organization established Dec at the fifth plenary session of the seventh term of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers\u2019 Party has been granted enough power to monitor even the heads of the North Korean military\u2019s General Political Bureau and other core commands and has the authority to observe the private lives of military officers as high as the rank of general \u201cThe new Military Government Guidance Department began operations in early March \u201d a military source in Pyongyang who asked not to be identified told RFA\u2019s Korean Service recently \u201cCurrently members of the organization have been dispatched to the corps headquarters to examine the lifestyles of high ranking military officials including corps commanders looking into their capabilities and incomes \u201d the source said \u201cUntil now it has been the General Political Bureau that\u2019s in charge of stopping abuses in military power but since the new organization is under the direct control of the supreme command headed by Kim Jong Un officials of the Political Bureau who wield enormous power are themselves now subject to inspection \u201d the source added Describing how the organization was formed he told RFA \u201cOn Kim Jong Un\u2019s orders the members of the Military Government Guidance Department were selected by the Central Party and deputized while dressed in military uniforms \u201d \u201cThe organization was made to protect and maintain the Central Committee and the supreme leader \u201d the source added According to the source the department\u2019s inspections into military and government leaders can also be done without their knowledge \u201cIn addition to the official inspection the Military Government Guidance Department can secretly investigate the ideological trends and private lives of corps leaders division leaders and brigade commanders as well as arrest suspects immediately if any elements are found against the regime \u201d the source said Another military source who asked not to be named from North Pyongan province told RFA that although the department is relatively new the creation of such an organization had been discussed towards the end of the administration of Kim\u2019s late father and predecessor Kim Jong Il who ruled from to \u201cI understand the Military Government Guidance Department was conceived of during the Kim Jong Il era when Kim Jong Un was in charge of the military operation department of the General Staff department \u201d the second source said \u201cSince the inauguration of Kim Jong Un\u2019s administration the supreme leadership has mobilized the General Political Bureau to clean up the party and the military\u2019s power base So now there is a closed door organization to inspect the high ranking officials of the General Political Bureau \u201d the second source added According to the source political conflict with the United States over North Korea\u2019s nuclear capabilities and sanctions meant to suppress those capabilities has served as a catalyst for corruption \u201cEven the General Political Bureau officials are worried about the instability of the regime so corruption is rampant This has made the supreme command nervous so that is why they created the Military Government Guidance Department \u201d the second source said \u201cThey want to tighten discipline in the People\u2019s Armed Forces and eliminate the possibility of reactionary military officials \u201d the second source added The second source confirmed that the department was specifically made to watch the watchers \u201cAbove all the main task of the Military Government Guidance Department is to assess ideological trends corruption and combat readiness

Interest Online", "text": "Key point For the first time since World War II a major power is deploying military capabilities which could do us harm in our region of primary strategic concern Two important military developments recently should give China pause for thought The first one is the announcement by Prime Minister Scott Morrison of a billion upgrade to the Royal Australian Air Force base at Tindal which is about kilometres south of Darwin to lengthen the runway so that US B strategic bombers as well as our own KC air to air refuelling aircraft can operate from there The second development is the announcement by the US State Department that Australia has been cleared at a cost of about billion to purchase AGM 158C long range anti ship missiles LRASM which can be fired from our F A Super Hornets and the F 35s when they are delivered The significance of these two developments occurring at the same time should not be underestimated and certainly not in Beijing Morrison described the upgrades to Tindal as being \u2018the sharp end of the spear\u2019 for Australian and US air operations in the Indo Pacific As ASPI\u2019s Peter Jennings observed the decision to expand the Tindal airbase is a giant strategic step forward and could be the basis for a greater leadership role for Australia in the region When the upgrade including major runway extensions fuel stockpiles and engineering support is completed Tindal will be the most potent military base south of Guam And\u2014for the time being at least\u2014it is beyond the reach of Chinese conventional ballistic missiles The LRASMs will give Australia a highly capable stand off anti ship strike capability with much longer range than we\u2019ve had before Unclassified sources state that this missile has a range of at least \u2013 kilometres It can conduct autonomous targeting relying on on board targeting systems to acquire the target without the presence of prior precision intelligence or supporting data services like GPS It\u2019s claimed that these capabilities will enable positive target identification and target acquisition and engagement of moving ships in extremely hostile environments The missile is designed with countermeasures to evade active defence systems Apparently multiple missiles can work together to share data to coordinate and attack in a swarm The LRASM is also capable of hitting land targets Its own data link allows other military assets to feed the missile a real time electronic picture of the battlespace This missile only achieved operational capability with US Super Hornets in November last year Its confirmation for sale to Australia so quickly reflects the closeness of the alliance This is a major new strike deterrent acquisition for Australia It reflects the concerns of the defence force about Australia\u2019s strike capabilities since the retirement of the F in and the fact that it takes time for the navy\u2019s Collins class submarines to transit to Southeast Asian or South Pacific waters We are now in an era in which China is contesting our strategic space in the \u2018inner arc\u2019 stretching from the Indonesian archipelago and Papua New Guinea down to Solomon Islands and Vanuatu the latter of which are about kilometres from our east coast military bases For the first time since World War II a major power is deploying military capabilities which could do us harm in our region of primary strategic concern In that sense we are now in a period of defence warning time because a change of intention is all that a potential adversary would need to do to transform a presence into a direct military threat It is therefore important that we have the capability to push back against those who would use their increasing military power to restrict our strategic space and coerce us In the coming years we will need to consider acquiring weapons systems with even longer range The US is developing a ground launched version of the latest Tomahawk maritime strike missile a boost glide anti ship missile a hypersonic cruise missile and potentially a Pershing III anti ship intermediate range ballistic missile These could have ranges of around kilometres to more than kilometres These sorts of weapons would enable Australia to strike at targets well into the South China Sea and the South Pacific Some previous RAAF chiefs have been strong proponents of acquiring Northrop Grumman\u2019s B Raider long range strategic stealth bomber The project is still in the development stage but the planes have an estimated cost of around US million each and their maintenance costs will be huge It would probably be cheaper and more cost effective if Australia focused on long range land based anti ship missiles Taken together then the upgrading of Tindal and the acquisition of LRASMs reinforce the US alliance and foreshadow a significantly more potent Australian deterrent capability to assert control over our own region of

Malave Subject RFC Popcorn Linux Distributed Thread Execution Date Wed Apr This patch set adds the Popcorn Distributed Thread Execution support to the kernel It is based off of Linux commit 72a20ce We are looking for feedback on design and implementation from the community Background Popcorn Linux is a collaborative work by the Software and Systems Research Group at Virginia Tech It is based on the original thesis by David Katz Principal contributors since include Sang Hoon Kim Maria Sadini Ajith Saya Vicnent Legout Antonio Barbalace and Binoy Ravindran Popcorn Linux is a Linux kernel based software stack that enables applications to execute with a shared code base on distributed hosts Popcorn allows applications to start execution on a particular host and migrate at run time to a remote host Multi threaded applications may migrate any particular thread to any remote host Unlike userspace checkpoint restart solutions e g CRIU Popcorn enables seamless and dynamic migration across hosts during execution no user interaction and ensures coherent virtual memory across hosts for concurrent thread execution Popcorn Linux implements a software based distributed shared memory by extending Linux s virtual memory subsystem and it enables processes on different machines to observe a common and coherent virtual address space Coherency of virtual memory pages of different hosts is ensured using a reader replicate writer invalidate page level consistency protocol The version of Popcorn Linux presented in this RFC supports only x86 configurations The stack in this RFC includes a modified kernel and a userspace run time library There is a more advanced version of Popcorn Linux that allows applications to concurrently execute across ISA different cores e g X86 ARM This feature rich version adds a customized LLVM compiler toolchain to the stack Nevertheless this RFC focuses on a simpler single architecture form of Popcorn that does not require compiler modifications Both the compiler toolchain and the heterogeneous implementation of Popcorn Linux may be found at these github locations It should be noted the heterogeneous version is under active development and is likely less stable than the one provided in this patch Heterogeneous Popcorn Linux LLVM Compiler More information on the Popcorn Linux research team and their current work may be found here Popcorn Library The Popcorn kernel library is a suite of light tests that showcase the use of Popcorn s core system calls These tests allow for a basic migration of processes and threads between or more nodes The test suite is being expanded and may be found in at The branch matching this RFC kernel code base is called upstream Reverting L1TF protections This initial iteration of code currently reverts L1TF side channel protections on x86 systems Future iterations of code will comply with the L1TF patches and current pagetable walking algorithms Security Disclaimer Popcorn Linux assumes that it is operating across equally trusted host systems This patch set is intended to initiate discussions and should not be built and loaded onto public internet connected machines Popcorn Linux as is runs a kernel based daemon that listens for messages passed to it via a TCP socket This IP based message layer is intended for Popcorn testing and development purposes only given obvious latency and security

that have ever looked as promising and bizarrely relevant as Space Force Looking to be something between The Pentagon Wars and The Office the show clearly aims to skewer the military industrial complex and the current state of space affairs in the most entertaining way possible and right now we couldn t need it more It will probably end up having more in common with cringe worthy reality than fiction Listen I am highly biased on this topic The Office is one of the biggest comedy achievements in human history It s a show that even after rewatching it multiple times you can throw an episode on and forget about your problems and just commit to the laughs In fact in this bleak and sudden age of coronavirus I have been doing exactly that It simply never gets old Steve Carell was the heart and soul of the show even though it had one of the best ensemble casts ever with each member having unique and often unlikely comedy capabilities to deploy with uncanny precision Still Michael Scott absolutely owned the camera He was so familiar yet so alien to all of us He was a guy you loved just a little bit more than you hated When Carell left after the seventh season the show just wasn t the same although it was still good for some laughs and the guest stars notably James Spader as Robert California were excellent Now Carell and the creator of the U S version of The Office Greg Daniels have teamed up for Space Force and they brought with them an insane cast of familiar players that will make this show failing pretty damn challenging The show revolves around General Naird an Air Force pilot who always dreamed about running the branch but instead he gets assigned to start Space Force Obviously the premise is ripped from the headlines The new branch s almost comic book like superficial absurdity has already drawn a ton of public interest as well as the fact that it is one of President Trump s pet projects So the show is already mirroring reality to a remarkable degree

disaster movies end \u2013 with cities ruined and civilisation in utter disarray \u2013 XCOM Chimera Squad is about the horrifying aftermath of an alien invasion Our heroic band of scientists and soldiers may have defeated the extraterrestrial conquerors at the end of acclaimed strategy sequel XCOM but the world they won back is barely functioning One squad member mentions that he\u2019s from Canada before acknowledging that this was when such a thing existed A mission briefing notes that hard cash is the only currency after the implosion of the global financial system To complicate things further the aliens are still here The stranded remnants of the invasion force are trying their best to assimilate into human society with varying degrees of success And even the very notion of humanity is in flux thanks to the widespread creation of human alien hybrids during the occupation More finessed battles \u2026 XCOM Chimera Squad Chimera Squad takes place in City which is not unlike the Los Angeles depicted in 1980s sci fi franchise Alien Nation In an experiment in integration humans and aliens live alongside each other \u2013 and the city\u2019s police force has to reflect the multi species make up of the people it\u2019s protecting Players must command a squad of human alien and hybrid law enforcers harnessing their various abilities to tackle a new threat to the city\u2019s uneasy peace Lizard woman Torque can lash out her tongue and yank enemies from across the map Axiom the Muton can race up to foes and pound them into meat with his fists and Verge a former Thin Man the infiltration arm of the alien\u2019s invasion force can access enemies\u2019 minds and control them like puppets After years of being tormented by these abilities in previous XCOM games it\u2019s wonderfully cathartic to finally use them for yourself Then again not much else has really changed In essence Chimera Squad is XCOM with some genetic splicing The base building is gone although you\u2019re still tasked with researching weaponry and training recruits in between fights and the scope is limited to a single city rather than the whole planet But now you have a permanent crew of unique characters and battles are smaller and more finessed Rather than attacking with your team then waiting with fingers crossed for the computer to have its go in Chimera Squad you can see the order in which each combatant will make their move This allows you to focus assaults on the enemy who will attack next and even change the turn order with special moves It\u2019s satisfying to work your way through a room methodically picking off the most urgent threats although it does tend to make the game a little easier than its predecessor Perhaps the most radical change is the introduction of a team of superheroes with unique abilities battles can play out very differently accordingly to which squad members you select The flipside is that unlike in XCOM the characters cannot die If they bleed out you\u2019re simply sent back to the last save This takes away some of the tension of the previous games all those times spent agonising over whether to press on or replay a lengthy level because one of your squad bought it at the end Still the little snippets of characterisation are welcome in what can be a clinical genre \u2013 although the developers could have gone further perhaps adding crew specific missions as in Mass Effect or something akin to Fire Emblem \u2019s relationship building XCOM Chimera Squad is essentially the Agents of Shield to XCOM \u2019s Avengers It gently plays with the formula and tells the peripheral stories of a much wider world on a much tighter budget and with much smaller stakes In other words it\u2019s XCOM but chilled \u2013

authorization granted for new biomaterial collection approach Rutgers Professor Andrew Brooks chief operating officer and director of technology development at RUCDR Infinite Biologics Photo Rutgers University The Food and Drug Administration FDA has granted emergency use authorization EUA to Rutgers\u2019 RUCDR Infinite Biologics and its collaborators for a new collection approach that utilizes saliva as the primary test biomaterial for the SARS CoV coronavirus the first such approval granted by the federal agency The new saliva collection method which RUCDR developed in partnership with Spectrum Solutions and Accurate Diagnostic Labs ADL will allow for broader population screening than the current method of nose and throat swabs \u201cThe impact of this approval is significant \u201d said Andrew Brooks chief operating officer and director of technology development at RUCDR who also is a professor in the School of Arts and Sciences Department of Genetics at Rutgers University\u2013New Brunswick \u201cIt means we no longer have to put health care professionals at risk for infection by performing nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal collections We can preserve precious personal protective equipment for use in patient care instead of testing We can significantly increase the number of people tested each and every day as self collection of saliva is more quick and scalable than swab collections All of this combined will have a tremendous impact on testing in New Jersey and across the United States \u201d Soon after the Rutgers ADL team received notification from the FDA on Saturday the White House\u2019s COVID testing task force called Brooks to offer congratulations and support and to ask about any specific hurdles to expanding testing and enabling other laboratories to benefit from the accomplishment Shortly after the White House call the research team was contacted by chief executive officers of some of the world\u2019s largest life sciences companies that are involved in COVID testing \u201cI have spoken with these companies\u2019 leadership to not only share knowledge but to create opportunities for continuing to help innovate during this crisis \u201d Brooks said \u201cWe will work closely with these new partners the FDA and the White House task force to leverage everything Rutgers has to offer to not only help our community but also make a global impact \u201d Rutgers University President Robert Barchi called the new saliva test a \u201cherculean effort that is great for the country and the world and by reflection great for our university \u201d \u201cSaliva testing will help with the global shortage of swabs for sampling and increase testing of patients and it will not require health care professionals to be put at risk to collect samples \u201d Brooks said \u201cSaliva testing will also be important for people who are in quarantine because they don\u2019t know how long it will be until they are no longer infectious This will allow health care workers to release themselves from quarantine and safely come back to work \u201d \u201cThe test can help hospital based and private physicians to accurately assess the infection status of more patients with RUCDR Infinite Biologics doing the analysis \u201d said Jay A Tischfield the founder chief executive officer and scientific director of RUCDR and a Distinguished Professor also in the Department of Genetics at Rutgers\u2013New Brunswick and at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School \u201cRutgers is proud to be on the cutting edge of the fight against the COVID pandemic \u201d said Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences Chancellor Brian Strom \u201cWe have long said our researchers and health care employees are working to help make the world well but never has it been more true than now \u201d Rutgers University\u2013New Brunswick Chancellor Chris Molloy agrees \u201cRutgers has always been on the leading edge of research and discovery We are proud of the work we do and the positive impact it has on the world \u201d The FDA\u2019s approval of the new saliva testing approach is the second major announcement in recent days from RUCDR which launched a genetic testing service for the coronavirus that can test thousands of samples daily With the new saliva test that number may increase to tens of thousands of samples daily The tests are available to the RWJBarnabas Health network which has partnered with Rutgers University and is New Jersey\u2019s most comprehensive health care system including Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital University Hospital in Newark and many other facilities including several county health departments Starting Wednesday Rutgers in partnership with the Middlesex County government and RWJBarnabas

"Military spending millions to buy up \u2014 and preserve \u2014 land around Utah's Camp Williams - Salt Lake Tribune", "text": "Not long after Mormon pioneers settled in the Salt Lake Valley in the 1840s and \u203250s the U S Army sent troops to Utah to assert control over the territory recently acquired from Mexico The soldiers honed their shooting and artillery skills miles south of Salt Lake City in the West Traverse hills terrain that later became Camp Williams straddling the line between Salt Lake and Utah counties For decades this area was comfortably far from homes and businesses as Camp Williams\u2019 mission evolved toward combat training the kind of action that doesn\u2019t mesh with urban land uses Agricultural fields and big game winter range along the installation\u2019s perimeter are now filling with neighborhoods putting public safety and the Utah National Guard mission at risk This suburban sprawl has spurred commanders to embark on an ambitious private land conservation campaign resulting in the preservation of recreational access and open spaces in places that could otherwise become neighborhoods Since the Department of Defense and partner agencies have invested million to acquire conservation easements on acres of pastures and undeveloped lands inside what is known as the West Traverse Sentinel Landscape a buffer zone around the acre camp Christopher Cherrington The Salt Lake Tribune \u201cBecause of the terrain we get a lot of other agencies that come and train including active duty personnel Navy SEALs the FBI local law enforcement It\u2019s a real gem as far as training \u201d said Brig Gen Tyler Smith who was commander of Camp Williams when the program started By shielding the surrounding private land from development the Guard not only secures military interests but also enhances Salt Lake and Utah counties\u2019 quality of life and natural environment he said Smith envisions a mile nonmotorized trail crossing these easements and encircling Camp Williams someday Herriman has already built eight miles of trail on land conserved in part under the program called Army Compatible Use Buffer or ACUB \u201cIt\u2019s really a win win scenario Smith said \u201cThe installation wins because it ensures compatible use surroundings its borders and the community wins because it provides recreational opportunities and wildlife habitat \u201d \u2018Significant open land\u2019 More than a third of land now encumbered with easements around Camp Williams was set aside in the form of donated development rights by the property owners according to Paul Raymond the Utah National Guard s ACUB program manager Among those farming families who gave up some of their land\u2019s value without full compensation were descendants of Grant Smith They recently completed a third conservation deal \u2014 for million \u2014 with the Guard The property owners are no relation to Brig Gen Smith who has since been promoted to assistant adjutant general with the Utah Joint Force Headquarters In the third deal announced last week federal agencies and Utah officials paid for easements on acres of the Smiths\u2019 land west of Eagle Mountain according to the Conservation Fund a nonprofit that put the transfer together \u201cThis has been a multiyear project and we are very appreciative for the way our partners tirelessly worked through the challenges \u201d landowner Jim Smith said Now in perpetuity there is an open land buffer for the training at Camp Williams as well as a space that our children and grandchildren can enjoy as the rest of this valley fills in with housing I am confident that these buffer areas could be the only significant open land in this area in the future \u201d Most of the money came through the Defense Department\u2019s Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration program while the federal Natural Resources Conservation Service put up million and Utah kicked in Ration easement shows that agricultural values environmental benefits and military missions go hand in hand said Emily Fife the service\u2019s state conservationist \u201cThrough our wonderful partnerships we can find that common ground and develop solutions to accomplish so many benefits for this great nation This was the first easement secured near Camp Williams since the Utah Legislature established the West Traverse Sentinel Landscape at the Guard\u2019s urging in It was also among its most costly weighing in at about an acre Establishing this conservation zone is critical to securing federal funds for future easements according to Brig Gen Smith \u201cWe are competing for dollars with other military installations \u201d he said \u201cWhat makes us more competitive is the state passed the landscape bill and appropriated money into the account That demonstrates a partnership The program manager likes to see other people with skin in the game \u201d Rising prices Camp Williams has prioritized acquiring easements on another acres mostly near firing ranges but they will not come cheap To date million in federal money has been spent nationally since to acquire easements on acres in seven \u201csentinel landscapes around military bases not including the new one in Utah according to the Sentinel Landscapes Partnership Also going into these efforts was million in state million in local and million in private funds The Utah National Guard has identified acres around Camp Williams it wants to preserve from development Conservation deals have now been nailed down on more than a quarter of those lands The priority lands for future deals abut firing ranges near Saratoga Springs Herriman and Cedar Fort But each deal gets more costly on a per acre basis than the last This is because the land sitting in a scenic setting near a growing metropolis gets more desirable every year \u201cThe escalation in prices is indicative of what\u2019s going on around the camp The more houses are getting backed up against the camp and the more commercial development the more the land values go up \u201d said Mike Ford the Conservation Fund\u2019s Southwest director \u201cOpen space and trails are amenities that make an abundance of sense but if we don\u2019t deal with it now they will be lost forever \u201d When President Woodrow Wilson set aside a seven mile stretch of the Traverse Mountains for Army maneuvers the year was the United States was preparing to enter the war raging across Europe and the Salt Lake and Utah valleys were covered in farms with a few smelters along the Jordan River and herds of mule deer roaming the foothills The intervening century has brought profound and permanent changes to how people use the land highlighting the importance of planning for the future Few thought to buy up development rights when they were cheap With residential development closing in on Camp Williams\u2019 firing ranges the government has little choice but to pay private property owners to keep their land open in both senses of the word \u201cYou can still enjoy the beauty and explore the space around Camp Williams Brig Gen Smith said \u201cPeople come to Utah because they want that outdoor experience They don\u2019t want urban development everywhere you look \u201d", "page_url":

so many options it can be a bit overwhelming to choose which Arc\u2019teryx jacket is the right one for a given activity I used one of the jackets during an ice climbing trip earlier this year In fact most of us on the trip were outfitted with one Activities included hiking in crampons up and down trails to the various ice faces along and climbing up those faces In between time would be spent either belaying fellow climbers or standing around waiting for our turn to climb So the conditions were much like a professional user We had movement interrupted by sedentary periods It was pretty cold down to the teens but warmed up if you could get in the sun I never overheated in the jacket but did vent the front zip during movement Once we were on site the Windstopper shell was welcome to shed some of the breeze that would occasionally pick up and dust us with loose powder Because of this I was glad I had the Hoody as I really added my Alpha LT Shell to the mix As for pants I wore Wool long underwear and Alpha Pants Although I brought COLD WX LT GEN2 Pants with me in my pack I never bothered putting them on since I was able to move around enough to keep my legs warm This is the way

Bob Behnken NASA NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley inside Crew Dragon SpaceX The SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft for its first crew launch from American soil arrived at the launch site on Feb On April NASA and SpaceX completed an end to end demonstration of the teams\u2019 ability to safely evacuate crew members from the Fixed Service Structure during an emergency situation at Launch Complex 39A at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida SpaceX Another view from the test SpaceX Bob Behnken participates in an exercise to verify the crew can safely and quickly evacuate from the launch pad in the unlikely event of an emergency NASA Officials from NASA and SpaceX spoke at a series of briefings on Friday to preview the upcoming flight of a Crew Dragon spacecraft from Kennedy Space Center Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the discussions was after nine years since the space shuttle s retirement how very close astronauts really are to launching from Florida again into orbit So far everything remains on track for a May launch to the International Space Station on a Falcon rocket As the briefings were taking place in fact SpaceX conducted its 27th and final test of Crew Dragon s Mark parachute system This successful test essentially closes out the last major technical hurdle standing between the spacecraft and launch The biggest pre launch concern that emerged on Friday seems to be weather The Crew Dragon spacecraft has a few launch constraints a satellite does not and mission managers also need to watch downrange weather because of potential abort scenarios Dragon can return to Earth at almost any point and it would be good to have relatively calm seas for an emergency ocean landing Finally there is the fact that storm systems often kick up during the afternoon in Florida in late spring and summer The launch is scheduled for 32pm ET UTC There is a very high chance of scrub due to weather given the time of year said Benji Reed director of crew mission management at SpaceX A back up launch opportunity is available on May Whenever it happens Crew Dragon s flight will make history Only eight new spacecraft carrying humans into orbit have ever launched\u2014US Mercury Gemini Apollo and Space Shuttle vehicles Russian Vostok Voskhod and Soyuz vehicles and the Chinese Shenzhou spacecraft This is the first time one has been built and launched by a private company Over the next four weeks NASA and SpaceX engineers and managers will seek to finalize their paperwork and reviews to ensure a safe flight of Crew Dragon This work will culminate with an agency level Flight Readiness Review meeting presently scheduled for May After this the spacecraft and rocket will enter final preparations for the mission Following launch it will take about hours for Dragon to catch up to and dock with the space station Launch profile for the Demo mission SpaceX Mission profile for the Demo flight SpaceX The astronauts for this mission Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have already been limiting their contact with other people and they will formally enter quarantine facilities at Johnson Space Center on May About six days before launch they will fly on a NASA aircraft to Kennedy Space Center where they will remain in quarantine before the launch All of this is fairly standard fare for a US launch as a lot of these protective procedures occurred during the space shuttle program What will be difficult for the crew however is not being able to share the day of launch with the wider public NASA has encouraged people to stay home and not congregate for the launch Large numbers of friends and family members typically attend the launch and those activities too will be curtailed Boy I wish we could make this into something really spectacular NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said But having large crowds of hundreds of thousands of people at the Kennedy Space Center now is not the time for that We\u2019re asking people not to travel to the Kennedy Space Center It makes me sad to even say it Listing image by NASA", "page_url": "https://arstechnica.com/?p=1672478", "label": 1, "score": "210705_news_172834"},

Patterson Air Force Base Ohio according to a Tuesday release from the Air Force in a field demonstration of its ability to break down per and polyfluoroalkyl substance \u201cWe are trying to destroy or degrade PFAS impacted groundwater using electrical discharge plasma \u201d principal investigator Selma Mededovic of Clarkson University said in the release The idea is that argon gas from the reactor concentrates perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid known as PFOS and PFOA generating plasma at the surface The plasma then breaks down the PFAS molecules This is the only technology that actually destroys PFAS molecules that has been demonstrated at this scale it doesn\u2019t just remove them from water \u201d co principal investigator Tom Holsen said in the release \u201cAll of the other demonstrations that we\u2019re aware of remove it from the water through filtration so there is still a PFAS containing waste Our method actually destroys PFAS \u201d Over the course of two weeks contracted researchers from Clarkson and GSI Environmental pulled hundreds of gallons of groundwater running the reactor with different time periods and amounts of water to find the best settings Whether the reactor can be scaled across the military remains to be seen according to the release as the researchers evaluate the treated water samples The chemicals found in everything from fabric carpet cookware and food packaging are of particular concern on military bases where they are a key ingredient in the fire fighting foam used to put out blazes after an aircraft

standards but organizations like the Environmental Working Group have argued that those levels are still too high \u201cPFOS PFOA is a national issue and research like this could lead to the breakthroughs we need to address potential contamination \u201d Mark Correll Deputy Assistant Air Force Secretary for installations energy and the environment said in the release Defense Secretary

instituted a buddy system that groups individuals into cohorts or pods as the service attempts to stave off the spread of the novel coronavirus officials say Airmen at Sheppard Air Force Base Texas for example have begun implementing the containment strategy known as a ring one cadre It groups together airmen who would normally commingle on a day to day basis explained Col Kenyon Bell installation commander and head of the 82nd Training Wing This has been an evolution Bell said in an interview Tuesday Each time we start to formalize our containment strategy and move down how we minimize exposure it evolves His comments came after photos sent to Military com last week showed airmen with the 82nd walking around the base closely together even as top officials including Defense Secretary Mark Esper stressed that troops should strictly follow the Centers of Disease Control guidance to stay six feet or more apart whenever possible Related The Pentagon Says Troops Are Social Distancing Why Do These Photos Say Otherwise Families of airmen attending the training raised concerns in a private Facebook group and began pressing base officials asking whether leaders were ignoring the call for social distancing During a Facebook Live video chat Friday Bell explained the new system calling it a ring one cadre of people or those airmen who interact the most with each other on duty Bell said the groups in his office for example have split up in order to avoid unnecessarily bringing in other airmen We need to physically distance ourselves as much as practical he said Tuesday When we re marching around yes we can break down into smaller groups But if for instance Bell came down with COVID symptoms and had to quarantine for days his cohort office buddies would do the exact same thing he said The commander said he s been calling the system physical distancing instead of social distancing because airmen are still encouraged to keep social connection during this difficult time The part that I think a lot of people have a hard time grappling with is when we re in a training environment there are some cases that you just cannot physically stay six feet apart from each other and accomplish our mission Bell said He gave the example of trainees changing an aircraft tire which is a two person job at least Since we have been deemed essential to the mission and we have to accomplish that training then we accept some risk in that area he said Sheppard is home to the largest technical training wing in the Air Force producing roughly graduates annually according to a fact sheet provided to Military com At any given time there are between and technical trainees at Sheppard assigned to six training squadrons Trainees span more than Air Force specialties in the aircraft maintenance logistics and civil engineering career fields the service said The ring one concept is not completely regimented A commander who oversees people isn t picking which airmen stay within a specific person group nor are they assigning airmen to groups Bell said That happens as a natural progression to keep a small ring one group as possible he added Bell imposed a restricted movement order March for the trainees living on base It s been several decades since I ve been years old and now they are confined to a space of a mile fence line to live work and play for an indefinite period of time So as you can imagine there s some frustration there s some restlessness he said But at the same time by and large we have made a tremendous effort to educate people on why we do it Grouping Shift Work The 80th Flying Training Wing which has student pilots at any given time shares Sheppard with the 82nd While the 82nd has strictly limited its trainees movement the 80th doesn t have the same luxury since some of its personnel including international student pilots live off base Col Russell Driggers 80th commander has divided his airmen into what he called pods as small as six to seven airmen in addition to moving airmen around in blue and silver shifts to bring them on duty during very specific times Driggers said that all training is done within the assigned pods which are rotated one week on and one week off to further mitigate the possibility of interaction Unlike the 82nd which has courses that last anywhere from one month to more than seven months depending on specialty flight training students come in for roughly a one year curriculum The base has not accepted any new international students since Esper issued a stop movement order last month but students are free to leave if those nations will accept travel from the United States Driggers said Air Combat Command units are also aggressively using a shift like model said spokeswoman Leah Garton Maintenance personnel with the 1st Fighter Wing at Langley Air Force Base Virginia have split work into team A and B shifts alternating daily or weekly to minimize potential exposure Garton said Personnel on each shift are required to sanitize their equipment prior to shift turnover she said in an email Crew chiefs sterilize high maintenance personnel contact zones in and around cockpits and throughout maintenance work areas Meanwhile 20th Fighter Wing squadrons at Shaw Air Force Base South Carolina have been divided into two teams with alternating flying schedules Pilots and maintainers use rapid crew swaps and hot pit refueling to increase sortie generation while decreasing the amount of times maintenance personnel have to interact with the jet Garton said The examples listed illustrate the dynamics happening at each base around the country amid the coronavirus outbreak Bell said One Size Fits All Doomed to Fail Sheppard has had at least two confirmed COVID cases on the installation a member of the 80th and an employee at the base Starbucks The base no longer publicizes confirmed cases following a Pentagon order to stop doing so at the base level in order to preserve operational security measures I share the concerns and hear them frequently from family members who are chiming in and asking about Hey what s happening with my son daughter grandson granddaughter Bell said Again we re trying to offer that separation and minimize exposure and there are lots of efforts that are going on across the installation that will help us prevent the spread Last week when asked whether the Air Force would require all bases to institute the same specific protocols to protect airmen Chief of Staff Gen David Goldfein emphasized that commanders have to do what makes sense for their units Local commanders at the installation level have got the most situational awareness he told reporters during a Mitchell Institute Aerospace Nation chat April Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma doesn t look like Kunsan Air Base South Korea which doesn t look like Ramstein Air Base Germany he said Goldfein said he was not surprised to learn of the pod structures happening at Sheppard which he said is likely happening at other units too If my job is nuclear security and I m going out to the missile fields it wouldn t surprise me at all that that squadron is hanging pretty tough and tight together because they re having to operate in that unique environment the chief said A one size fits all approach to every installation is doomed to fail Again the individual who has the most situational awareness who is making the smartest most thoughtful decisions are those installation commanders Goldfein said We expect them to lead the way and we tell them

government has been no different despite an FBI announcement April that hackers could exploit weaknesses in videoconferencing software systems like Zoom to \u201csteal sensitive information target individuals and businesses performing financial transactions and engage in extortion \u201d The security concern is much greater than \u201c Zoom bombing \u201d attacks reported by users whose chats have been infiltrated by hackers shouting profanities or posting lewd images Experts say the teleconferencing app may introduce security risks not only during government employees\u2019 Zoom sessions but to data that resides on government computers \u201cIf there are vulnerabilities the app can jeopardize the security of data on the computer on which it is installed or even potentially on other

government employees from the Pentagon to Capitol Hill not all of whom are aware of its potential risks I m not aware of any issues with Zoom \u201d a senior official in the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told a small group of reporters a day after the FBI guidance was issued The U S defense official said he was using Zoom to videoconference amid the need to social distance but when pressed by VOA about the potential security risks the official added that every discussion his team had while on Zoom was \u201cat the unclassified level Government employees can use Zoom for Government a paid tier service that is hosted in a separate cloud authorized by the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program It is unclear however how many government employees have differentiated between the two services thus far To date Zoom remains on the approved list of mobile phone applications for U S Department of Defense employees according to multiple officials However one senior defense official said the Pentagon was currently looking into \u201cguidance adjustments\u201d for the application Multiple employees at the State Department have also been using Zoom for official business One staff member said he and his colleagues have daily Zoom meetings and have not received any guidance against using the app for internal and external communication Assistant Secretary of State for Political Military Affairs R Clarke Cooper last week tweeted about his department\u2019s use of a \u201cZoom Room \u201d The State Department sent an email to employees Thursday morning saying that the free version of Zoom is not authorized for the conduct of official business or on official Department devices used to access OpenNet It told employees to use Cisco Webex FAN Google Meet Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business While the Government version of Zoom may be reviewed for Department adoption in the future Zoom has been approved for use on Dedicated Internet Networks DIN the email said In light of new security concerns the Bureau of Information Resource Management office of Information Assurance IA will take a fresh look at this and address any cybersecurity concerns that may exist On Capitol Hill a U S lawmaker\u2019s office insisted that VOA use Zoom for an interview despite the FBI warning The lawmaker\u2019s press secretary told the reporter that there would not be security issues because the meeting was password protected A Zoom spokeswoman told VOA Zoom takes user security \u201cextremely seriously \u201d \u201cA large number of global institutions ranging from the world\u2019s largest financial services companies to leading telecommunications providers government agencies universities and others have done exhaustive security reviews of our user network and

blogpost I\u2019m going to go into more depth on each of these topics below but first I want to talk about what I\u2019m looking for short term What we need Currently we\u2019re looking for three kinds of people Companies and other institutions who want to be early customers These tend to be larger institutions who have an appetite for scalable Python They want to purchase significant amounts of training support today to build out their capabilities and are excited about participating in the design and testing process of software products that they will want to purchase in the future Engineers who understand open source software the PyData stack and effective communication These folks will work with early customers to identify bugs and features in the open source software and then improve that open source software to meet their needs Dask touches a lot of the PyData software ecosystem today and a lot of those connections need to be improved as we scale out Incentives between for profit companies and the open source software community are well aligned here and I think that we can all do some great work together Engineers who understand Kubernetes cloud deployment enterprise authentication and security We need to make it smoother for large teams of data scientists to use Dask effectively within an organization For this we need engineers who deeply understand the pain of enterprise deployment This is likely to be not entirely open source and something that we charge for long term We\u2019re looking to build a diverse and remotely distributed team For more information see coiled io jobs What we plan to do This company will offer support and products around Dask Today we can offer support This will inform product development Support and Training for Dask We want to make institutions successful at scaling Python Usually the first step along this path isn\u2019t buying a particular product it\u2019s learning more about where tools like Dask can change the way we think about accessing distributed compute resources To this end we offer training and initial high level consultations to show people what\u2019s possible and then we sell long term support to make sure that Dask continues to work for their needs This gives assurance to depend on software Historically Dask has gotten funding from lots of small short term consulting arrangements typically charging by the hour We\u2019re now trying to move past this model and towards longer term partnerships This seems to be possible today many companies know that they want to invest in Dask long term and this gives us the stability we need to reliably hire out a larger team to support the use of the project Managed Deployments There are many ways to deploy Dask today If you know what you\u2019re doing and have access to a Kubernetes Cloud HPC cluster you can get to the point where you can click a button in a Jupyter Notebook and seamlessly connect to thousands of remote machines It\u2019s pretty magical\u2026 if you know what you\u2019re doing However there are many potential users of Dask today who are not deeply familiar with Kubernetes Cloud HPC Often they depend on IT administrators to manage their compute resources and make it easy for their teams to access these resources in a friendly and secure way that is in line with their institutions security and governance policies Today the best solution for this is likely Dask Gateway which provides a centralized place for IT to control access between Dask users and institutional hardware There is still plenty to do here around authentication software environments usage shaping and more We are excited to work with early customers to understand this pain and build products to remove it Observability Dask users today seem to appreciate the dashboard which gives live real time feedback that is critical to efficient computing When you support dozens or hundreds of users this information has increased value particularly if you have to pay a large and increasing commerical cloud bill We intend to build infrastructure to capture diagnostic information and roll it up for institutional users Where we are today We\u2019re still very early We\u2019re lining up an initial set of partner clients and a set of our first team members Today we can help customers start using Dask and ensure that they are successful in its use Over the next several months we hope to be able to roll out managed deployments and observability products with these early customers and from there out to the general public Investment I\u2019ve chosen to take on some investment to help make this happen with low risk Investment and OSS is an interesting topic these days I\u2019ll include more information on how and why I\u2019m doing this in a follow up post Engage If you are interested in getting involved please \u2026 Take a look at our website at coiled io Sign up for our newsletter at the bottom of that page

in our region In May of ISIS aligned militants seized parts of Marawi in the Southern Philippines initiating a nearly six month long siege before the return to government control By June Australia the United States China Russia and Israel had offered or were already providing military assistance The effects of that assistance endure well beyond the cessation of hostilities \u2013 our own relationship with the Philippines has improved as a result It is worth considering CT diplomacy in more detail particularly how the actions of competitors in our region effect our diplomatic access and influence What is CT Diplomacy I use the term \u2018CT diplomacy\u2019 to describe those CT activities conducted with a foreign nation that at least in part aim to enhance military and or government relations Therefore CT diplomacy covers a wide range of engagements from the provision of ammunition to a foreign CT unit through to training and advice all the way to the deployment of military forces into a conflict The result of CT diplomacy is generally twofold Most noticeably it supports the combatting of terrorism often in pursuit of the security of both states Secondly the less visible outcome is the opportunity for diplomatic engagement and dialogue hence improved relationships Terrorism as a diplomatic topic offers what few others can an almost universal moral alignment against its practice Diplomats or more broadly principals establishing relations with an international interlocutor can rely on terrorism as a suitable discussion point Condolences can be delivered reassurances provided alternate approaches discussed or support can be offered all while on a relatively safe footing Cultural and religious complexities require a deft touch Difficult engagement can be dialled back to simple messages and empathy That ease of engagement and the continued prevalence of terrorism ensures that CT diplomacy will remain prolific We should expect greater competition for CT relationships in our region as a result Discerning the impacts With competition comes the likelihood of an increasingly contested and congested CT landscape Regional partners might be flooded with CT engagements quickly surpassing their capacity to absorb support and limiting further opportunities for engagement But not all engagements are well thought through by donor or beneficiary Those in need rarely have the time to make a considered choice or access to viable alternatives The result could be a haphazard approach to force development and capability acquisition that sacrifices a coherent strategy for short term gain In May one month into the Marawi conflict gifted Chinese military materiel arrived in the Philippines In a hand over ceremony notably attended by President Duterte Chinese Ambassador Zhao Jianhua stated \u201cIt is a demonstration of our growing bilateral relationship It\u2019s also a demonstration of a new era of friendly and cooperative relationship between our two militaries \u201d This rhetoric demonstrates a strategic goal of access and influence carried in tactical acts of CT diplomacy Later President Duterte would credit a Chinese sniper rifle with the death of the militant leader In one simple move China deftly demonstrated the impact of rapidly delivering CT services to a state in need Nevertheless single acts do not necessarily cause enduring changes Chinese to Philippine military relations remain limited predominantly along CT and humanitarian aid and disaster relief lines However the long term effects may take shape below the strategic political level Even if gifted equipment were to receive poor reviews from users its impact will bleed into the political diplomatic and military systems Parts are needed for repair of existing weapons replacement systems may be desired ammunition is a persistent demand and specialised training may be sought or offered all of which establish long term relationships between the provider and the receiving country Though a receiving state may eventually decide not to purchase or accept support relational ties may already be established Once introduced soldiers establish familiarity with gifted weapons while senior leaders diplomats politicians and logisticians develop relationships with foreign interlocutors potentially resulting in foreign access and influence Countering that influence is difficult without persistent commitment Inaction or reductions in commitments to partner forces provide the gaps that competitors could exploit for access and influence Recent testimony from the Commander of United States Africa Command General Townsend is indicative of the emerging issues caused by competition in CT His assertion that \u2018 in Africa counter violent extremist organisations is global power competition\u2019 demonstrates the interwoven nature of global competition and CT Allowing voids in CT assistance to exist enables foreign powers to seize those opportunities to develop access and influence \u2013 potentially limiting our ability to affect strategic goals in the future The relationships built with partners during times of need are the bedrock of enduring partnerships As they say in the U S military community you can\u2019t surge trust Implications The implications for Australia are twofold Force posture and operational readiness needs to reflect a capability to provide CT assistance to regional partners on short notice across a broad variety of capabilities The role of experts in areas such as capability acquisition and force development will be important in the provision of useful advice to friends and partners Finally the ADF will face increasing competition for CT engagement with our partners If engagement is limited or partners are left in need even those considered \u2018partners of choice\u2019 may find alternate political or economic reasons to favour external partners Once others fill those gaps re

das so klingt wie die Landeger\u00e4usche von Ufos in alten Science Fiction Filmen Dar\u00fcber legt sich so meinen wir zu vernehmen ein Trommelteppich erzeugt von Schlagger\u00e4t aller Art Und \u00fcber allem erklingen schlie\u00dflich Chor\u00e4le \u00e4therischer Stimmen die beseelt sind vom Glauben an ein Leben auf fernen Sternen Ein Fest der Rhythmen und der Ges\u00e4nge irgendwo

der Menschen die sich in Kunzrus Roman dieser eigenwilligen Musikaus\u00fcbung hingeben Es handelt sich dabei um einen Haufen krimineller zugedr\u00f6hnter Hippies die Ende der Sechzigerjahre auf einer markanten Felsformation in der Mojave W\u00fcste ritualartige Sessions veranstalten um Boten von anderen Sternen willkommen zu hei\u00dfen Diese Aliens umkreisen angeblich unseren Planeten um

die sich in den Wonnen des Weltlichen suhlten aber in uralten Tonaufnahmen schwarzer Musiker das G\u00f6ttliche suchten Ein bisschen geht es so auch dem britischen S\u00e4nger der in G\u00f6tter ohne

Mumford Sons ihnen nacheiferten um noch viel ber\u00fchmter zu werden Das mag ein sehr spezieller Augenblick der Pop Historie gewesen sein aber der Ausverkauf des Spirituellen der sich damals vollzog ist ein Einstiegsszenario das man auch heute ohne tiefere Kenntnis der Materie nachvollziehen kann Missionen ins Unbekannte Urkomisch wie der dekadente britische Popstar da in R\u00f6hrenjeans durch die Kakteen der Mojave W\u00fcste stolpert Fremdk\u00f6rper in einer Welt die er in seinen Songs idealisiert hat Es ist der Auftakt f\u00fcr eine ganze Reihe von Missionen ins verhei\u00dfungsvolle

years of failed attempts the U S military may be on the verge of ending its love affair with brass cased ammunition something that predates the Spanish American War Traditional brass has dominated military small arms ammunition since U S troops stormed up San Juan Hill Cuba in The robust material performs well in the violent super heated space of weapon chambers during firing but its sheer weight has always been a problem for infantrymen and logisticians alike Advancements in body armor communications equipment and other tactical gear have weighed down U S combat troops in the Army and Marine Corps pushing individual loads well past pounds and degrading service members physical performance U S military studies have shown Both services have launched multiple efforts to lighten the weapons and equipment grunts carried while fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan but ammunition weight has always been an Achilles heel for these efforts Related Inside the Army s Quest for a Revolutionary New Bullet We have not gotten lighter in the last years Lt Gen Eric Smith commander of Marine Corps Combat Development Command told House Armed Services Committee members at a March hearing We have slowed the rate of weight increase which is unacceptable Early attempts at lighter plastic cased cartridge designs failed to meet military standards but recent technical advances by a few bold companies have prompted the Army and Marine Corps to launch new efforts to test polymer cased ammunition for infantry units In early January the Corps announced it plans to invest up to million in polymer cased caliber ammo to test in the Ma Deuce M2 machine gun a potent weapon used by both Army and Marine mounted combat units The Army s role in the Joint Lightweight Ammunition Integrated Product Team is to find a lightweight cased replacement for brass cased 62x51mm the caliber used in Army and Marine M240 machine guns and some sniper weapons The ultimate goal is to replace brass cased ammunition for all 62mm ammunition in the Army Becky Leonard spokeswoman for the Joint Program Executive Office for Armaments Ammunition at Picatinny Arsenal New Jersey told Military com The Army s Next Generation Squad Weapon Effort The Army is also evaluating lightweight cased 8mm ammunition for its Next Generation Squad Weapon NGSW effort which is designed to replace the M4A1 carbine and M249 Squad Automatic Weapon with more potent weapons that significantly lighten ammunition weight Two of the three firms competing in the final phase of the program Textron Systems and General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems Inc use polymer cased technology for their lightweight 8mm cartridges The third Sig Sauer Inc uses a more traditional brass case design with a stainless steel base to save weight in its NGSW prototypes The Army hopes to select a final design for both weapons from a single company in the first quarter of and begin fielding them to an infantry brigade combat team in the first quarter of modernization officials have said True Velocity Ammunition LLC shows off its line of polymer cased ammunition at SHOT Show Military com Matthew Cox But this is not the first time the Army has launched futuristic infantry weapon programs involving lightweight ammunition previous attempts resulted in failure In the service developed the Special Purpose Individual Weapon which fired plastic cased gauge rounds filled with multiple flechettes or darts in an attempt to increase the probability of hitting enemy targets The Advanced Combat Rifle program launched in pursued a similar goal with several of the prototypes featuring plastic cased ammunition The Army took a renewed interest in lightweight ammunition after when combat troops began to struggle under heavy combat loads in Iraq and Afghanistan Soldiers on combat patrols in Afghanistan typically carry to pounds of mission essential equipment this overload causes fatigue heat stress injury and performance degradation for soldiers according to a report by the Armament Research Development and Engineering Center ARDEC at Picatinny Arsenal on Alternative Cartridge Case Material and Design Despite years of research and development the Army s weapons and equipment are still too heavy to allow foot soldiers to maneuver safely under fire it states The only way to fully realize lightweight concepts is to look at novel ways of designing the system such as allowing the use of lightweight polymer composites for cartridge case applications Perhaps the most successful weapons programs involving polymer cased ammunition were launched in under the Army s Lightweight Small Arms Technology LSAT which resulted in successful tests of a special case telescoped CT ammunition in lightweight machine gun prototypes chambered for 56mm and 62mm and a rifle prototype chambered 5mm CT ammo Textron has incorporated the CT technology developed in LSAT into the 8mm cartridge it designed for its Next Generation Squad Weapon prototypes The technology relies completely on a plastic case to hold the propellant and the projectile The Move to Polymer Cased Ammo While the commercial ammunition market may stick with brass Wayne Prender senior vice president for Applied Technologies Advanced Programs at Textron told Military com that he is convinced that the U S military will eventually have to move toward polymer cased ammo Weight is a significant factor for a military application more so than a commercial application or sporting application Prender said You are carrying significantly more with significantly less support structure Ounces may not matter if you are going out for a hunt but ounces matter when your life depends on it That is why weight is such a significant factor in a military application and why we endeavored on it True Velocity Ammunition LLC began designing polymer cased ammunition for the military in and now makes the 8mm cartridge for General Dynamics NGSW prototype weapons It s not a new concept The U S Army has had a lightweight ammunition requirement for going on years now It s just that nobody has been able to bring a viable solution to the table said Pat Hogan chief marketing officer for True Velocity I think that the technology has arrived we have proven that it is viable Both Textron and True Velocity maintain that their polymer cased ammo designs offer about a percent weight savings over brass ammunition but also bring increased performance In polymer cased technology suffered from too many flaws to perform adequately under harsh combat conditions according to findings in the ARDEC report Since then companies like Textron and True Velocity have learned how to solve the problems highlighted in the report such as cracks on the case mouth neck body and base and insufficient high temperature resistance Brass is a conductor of heat and our composite case is an insulator Hogan said Brass conducts the heat during the ballistic event the brass superheats and then transfers that heat to the chamber of the weapon whereas polymer insulates the chamber from that heat Excessive heat buildup can cause ammo to cook off or explode in the weapon a problem True Velocity s case technology has licked he said Anecdotally we have run cook off tests through some of the belt fed platforms and in order to get the gun even hot enough to be in a position where you could even have a cook off we have to run brass ammo through a gun to get it hot enough where you can really test our ability to withstand cook offs Hogan said The cylindrical design of Textron s case telescoped ammunition really allows you to minimize exposure to heat Prender said explaining that the weapons system and CT ammo work together to dissipate heat We deal with heat a little bit different he said Our chamber pivots or rotates which enables us to remove the chamber and ammo from the latent heat that may exist after each round fires Textron System\u2019s 8mm polymer case telescoped ammunition that was designed for the Army\u2019s Next Generation Squad Weapon Textron Systems Other companies have shown enough promise in polymer cased ammo technology to attract the military s interest The Marines awarded a contract worth up million to MAC LLC for polymer cased caliber ammunition Military com reached out to MAC LLC but did not receive a response by press time Marine Corps Systems Command MCSC officials say that the contract is not an indication that the Corps plans to select MAC LLC polymer cased ammo as an alternative to brass ammunition The Marine Corps has not selected this polymer ammo as a replacement Emanuel Manny Pacheco spokesman for MCSC recently told Military com The current contract will provide ammunition for user evaluation Future contracts will be informed by the results of this evaluation But Lt Col Bill Lanham MCSC s deputy program manager for ammunition sounded confident in the contract award announcement that the Corps will one day transition to polymer cased ammo When we go to war we need more ammo to defeat our adversaries Lanham said in a Jan news release Polymer ammo gives Marines the opportunity to carry more ammunition or make trades with what gear is important to carry during combat The Marines plan to test the polymer cased caliber ammo in an operational validation scheduled for the third quarter of fiscal Lightweight Designs Meanwhile the Army s search for polymer cased 62x51mm identified three lightweight ammunition designs and is currently conducting a series of pre validation tests said Leonard who did not name the vendors or the lightweight materials used in the designs Once the pre validation test is completed on all three lightweight ammunition designs the Army will downselect a design and award a contract to the selected vendor to deliver rounds for qualification testing Leonard said The Army is assessing the production requirements for lightweight 62mm ammo that meets the current brass cased ammunition requirements she said adding that the service hopes to obtain a low rate initial production contract in late fiscal The advancements in polymer cased ammo however provide more than just weight savings both Prender and Hogan said explaining that the polymer cases can be molded to enhance accuracy and ballistic performance Engineers have learned how to shape the internal geometry of the case to allow the propellant or powder to perform more efficiently Prender said Better performance better performance in range better performance in velocity better performance in accuracy he said With a brass cartridge case you can t do anything to change the interior geometry Hogan said We can change the wall thickness or the interior shoulder angle or the configuration of the bottom of the cartridge case a lot of things to manipulate the ballistic event and basically shape the charge he added For Prender it s all about the science It really gets into advanced materials and material science which is really allowing us to push to the next level he said There is a reason why legacy weapon systems have kind of reached a ceiling and their ability to get better is incremental at best so you need an enabling technology Matthew Cox can be reached at matthew cox military com Related Bullpup or Belt Fed Prototypes for Army s Next Gen

Degeneration review \u2013 shocking, six-hour satire of Soviet science", "text": "E arlier this year at the Berlin film festival I saw the brutal and bizarre DAU Natasha It is one of feature films that have come out of the extraordinary multimedia DAU project devised by Russian film maker Ilya Khrzhanovsky who over the past decade has built a detailed full scale replica of the Moscow building housing the real life Institute of Physical Problems an experimental psychology unit presided over in the 60s by the free thinking Soviet scientist Lev Landau nicknamed \u201cDau\u201d and filled it with actors improvising the imagined lives of its scientist researchers on a basis He recorded the results in films video art and photo collections DAU Natasha about the unhappy life of the institute\u2019s fictional canteen manager was shocking enough Khrzhanovsky takes it to the next level with DAU Degeneration the 13th film in the series co directed with Ilya Permyakov a grisly satirical ordeal about Soviet fascist totalitarianism taking place in the institute\u2019s gloomy corridors shabby meeting rooms sinister experimental labs and occasionally the giant courtyard outside It\u2019s a monumental arthouse freakout weighing in at a mind boggling six hours Even now I\u2019m still not sure how to take it Khrzhanovsky may come to be seen as the post Soviet Alejandro Jodorowsky in his sheer ambition or something like the Pasolini of Sal\u00f2 Or the Days of Sodom And he resembles Charlie Kaufman\u2019s imaginary mad genius Caden Cotard played by Philip Seymour Hoffman who attempted a similar folie de grandeur in the film Synecdoche New York DAU Denegeration has the director\u2019s now familiar mannerisms of deadpan extended improv dialogue combined with a gonzo porn aesthetic non professionals being put through the wringer and a certain snuff horror nausea featuring a truly upsetting pig slaughtering scene that is all too real And the scenes of people being menaced bullied shocked \u2013 they look very real too The people playing the nasty people don\u2019t look they\u2019re pretending to be nasty It is commonplace to say that some films are scary and mad But this really is scary and mad The idea is that Denegeration takes place years on from Natasha It\u2019s the time of the Prague spring when the Soviet leadership is defensive and embattled The overall chief of the institute Lev Landau is ill and all but comatose following what appears to have been a stroke In real life he was incapacitated following a car crash Olga Olga Shkabarnya \u2013 Natasha\u2019s assistant in the first film \u2013 has risen to the status of administrator with a pair of stern glasses while Azhippo Vladimir Azhippo the horrifying state security interrogator from Natasha has been given the job of institute director and instantly makes it his business to clamp down on the louche goings on the drinking and the sex His predecessor was in the habit of harassing and sexually assaulting his secretaries Azhippo\u2019s disapproval of this is one thing of which we might approve though this audience response is an outlier and some younger students are infatuated with dancing to western style pop records Azhippo gathers a loyal cadre of the more uptight students around him and tells them to threaten and upset everyone else \u2013 which they do instantly revealing themselves to be fascist thugs racist antisemitic and homophobic And all the time the strange experiments continue on chimps pigs and babies DAU Degeneration is at one level a ferocious vision of Soviet communism as one big psychological experiment gone wrong and this merges with new style nationalism It isn\u2019t a stretch to see the hideous Azhippo as a Vladimir Putin alike But how is the satire working exactly From all the reports Khrzhanovsky used real life neo Nazis to play the thugs though \u2013 and this has to be said \u2013 they look ugly and stupid and fatuous My larger reservation apart from a general glassy eyed shock at the proceedings is that DAU Degeneration is not in essence telling us anything that wasn\u2019t in DAU Natasha and takes three and half more hours to do it But it is difficult to forget the scene where little schoolkids visit the institute to sing a bizarre song in praise of \u201cscience\u201d and then this song is repeated as a grotesque nationalist anthem There\u2019s something to be said for cinema as a disruptor DAU Degeneration is available on DAU Cinema", "page_url":

diagnosed cases of COVID among some million active duty troops with a death rate an order of magnitude less than in American society writ large Part of the success to date in keeping COVID out of the ranks is due to the prudence of commanders around the country and the world who have been given flexibility by Secretary of Defense Mark Esper to take measures they deem appropriate The armed forces have canceled or postponed large scale exercises that bring together thousands of people in one concentrated locale Social distancing protocols have been instituted on bases Basic training was temporarily suspended or scaled back as new screening and testing protocols were put in place much of it is already ramping back up Some services have also suspended certain \u201cpermanent change of station\u201d or PCS moves The naval services have been particularly careful not to let sailors and Marines go to sea if sick since as we all know ships are the perfect petri dishes for the virus\u2019s spread Not all of these measures can be sustained indefinitely The armed forces will face an increasingly challenging path forward through the rest of the calendar year and into Yet it is worth signaling to the American people \u2014 and to any of the nation\u2019s potential foes \u2014 why the resulting strains on readiness though significant should be tolerable One key structural advantage going forward is that the military is built to deal with attrition whether from battle or any other cause and still keep its fighting integrity Based on the standard shape of pandemic curves COVID could in theory infect or more of the U S population at a time though to date the total number of cases is still less than even if we quadruple the official tally Five percent would be a daunting figure for the nation\u2019s hospitals and health care system But it would be a manageable number for the military \u2014 even if all those infected were unavailable for a stretch of time For example the military\u2019s \u201cC scales\u201d of readiness \u2014 the overall way in which the services rate the immediate preparedness of main combat units usually on a sliding scale of C through C \u2014 anticipate degradations of in personnel and equipment for various reasons A unit that began in top shape but then suffered such attrition would still be considered capable even if weakened That said there are things the military needs to watch and adjustments it will need to consider in the months ahead One of Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis\u2019s goals when he took the reins of the Pentagon three years ago was to restore mission capable rates of most combat aircraft fleets to at least That standard has now largely been attained after several years of effort The key now is to prevent equipment maintenance backlogs from developing given the long recovery time associated with such backlogs Pilots need to fly to stay safe Modern simulators are outstanding but no substitute for a certain amount of the real thing especially for young pilots The same principle applies to other types of dangerous activities where like with parachuting you must get in a certain number of \u201creps\u201d each week or month to stay proficient The pipeline of new recruits must continue apace Today\u2019s American armed forces bring in of their total personnel strength each year meaning they also lose of existing personnel per year to retirement or the end of normal tours and enlistments So far it appears digital recruiting and other efforts continue to meet or exceed goals and a challenging U S economy will likely aid recruiting and retention in the months ahead Still leaders must remain watchful that they are meeting targets Some ships will need to set out on new deployments The U S Navy typically has or more ships at sea at a time With to month deployments the norm that translates into sending out to ships per month to spell those finishing their own tours That pace can be adjusted and temporarily relaxed if need be \u2014 indeed the COVID crisis provides an opportunity to rethink some standard ways of doing business But there is little doubt that at least several ships per month will need to be embarked on new deployments Soldiers and Marines are continuing today to train at the squad platoon and company levels while also maintaining marksmanship and other core skills But the nature of modern combined arms warfare requires that a training cycle include at least occasional exercises at higher echelons of battalion and brigade or regiment as well As with much of the rest of society the key to effectiveness in the above tasks will be widespread testing especially for those in close quarters Fortunately the availability of testing should increase substantially over the very time frame over which most readiness concerns will intensify That fact combined with a military culture that will adapt as always to adverse conditions bodes well for future U S military readiness even in these most challenging times The views here do not necessarily reflect those of the Departments of the Army Navy Air Force Defense or Homeland Security Coast Guard", "page_url": "https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/04/22/covid-19-and-military-readiness-preparing-for-the-long-game/", "label": 1, "score": "210705_news_163388"},

they are trained to do battle in the paralyzing cold of below zero battlefields Previously worn below the soldier s unit patch the once rectangular shaped tab was redesigned in November and now

cold weather training Maj Gen Peter Andrysiak Jr commander of U S Army Alaska said in the release We not only live here we thrive here and I want to make sure the tab properly recognizes our unique expertise The new Arctic Tab comes with a revised wear policy that U S Army Pacific Gen Paul LaCamera approved in February allowing all arctic operations qualified soldiers assigned to U S Army Pacific USARPAC units including major subordinate commands and direct reporting units to wear the tab while serving at USARPAC installations according to the release The new tab is not authorized for wear however when soldiers are on temporary duty or deployment status outside the USARPAC theater the release states The U S military has placed an increased emphasis on training soldiers and Marines for cold weather warfare as it prepares to face potential foes such as Russia China and North Korea Related US Steps Up Winter Warfare Training as Global Threat Shifts Soldiers who graduated the Northern Warfare Training Center s Cold Weather Leaders Course CWLC in January became the first to wear the redesigned tab according to the release Soldiers earn the Arctic Tab after completing either the CWLC or the Cold Weather Orientation Course where they become qualified to implement basic cold weather and ski training programs within their units to help overcome unique challenges faced while operating in harsh conditions the release adds CWLC is a day course that teaches small unit leaders everything from the basics of standing and moving on skis and snowshoes to a full range of arctic survival skills The Cold Weather Orientation Course is a four day class for commanders and staff officers to become more familiar with the skills required to plan and conduct operations in an arctic environment From jumping into minus bitter cold to conducting live fire exercises at minus in the Donnelly Training Area the Northern Warfare Training Center s team of professionals ensure our soldiers are ready to deploy fight and win in any arctic environment Command Sgt Maj Jeffrey Dillingham U S Army Alaska s senior enlisted leader said in the release We are the first line of defense in

of its next generation \u2018Pentamaran\u2019 platform to meet the specific challenges of long range autonomous operations while optimised to reduce fuel consumption and increase its adaptability across multiple applications These range across the defence and commercial sectors as the innovative vessel may be custom configured for military patrol intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance anti submarine warfare and hydrographic survey work The Pentamaran is designed to reduce drag as much as possible and tests prove it offers significant improvements compared to conventional hull forms such as mono hulls catamarans and trimarans The vessel features a very slender central hull and two smaller hulls or \u2018sponsons\u2019 on either side The sponsons are set one behind the other and when the vessel is operating on flat water the forward sponsons are not immerged providing roll stability effect in waves only meaning there is less volume permanently immerged and compared to a trimaran less resistance through the water Many applications Martin Bissuel Business Sector Lead for Specialised Ship Design at BMT said \u201cThe arrangement and careful positioning of the four sponsons makes all the difference The forward sponsons stay above the water and only come into action when the vessel rolls so not only the drag is reduced but the sea keeping characteristics are improved Compared to a trimaran hull form lateral accelerations are lower reducing g loadings on the structure as well as the antennae and sensors on deck The wide deck offers a large working area for multi role capabilities It can accommodate payloads or interface with other systems such as unmanned air vehicles \u201d A key consideration when a vessel is operating autonomously for long periods of time is the reliability of the propulsion setup which is essential to sustained operational readiness so BMT\u2019s engineers have integrated multiple independent power sources to increase reliability and survivability The design is the latest from the BMT\u2019s team of naval architects and engineers who have been at the forefront of innovative hull design for years principally in the defence

resisting rips splits tears and other common forms of damage typically incurred during missions or operations \u201d said Armin Wagner head of UF PRO product development \u201cFor example a wearer could be maneuvering through a patch of dense brush but thanks to the innovative way we construct Striker X Combat Pants they aren\u2019t likely to be snagged and torn by any of the branches \u201d Wagner continued \u201cWe also achieved greater ruggedness by streamlining all the seams \u201d Wagner added \u201cBecause none of them are uncovered the potential for rips to develop along the stitching is scant \u201d Despite the enhanced toughness Striker X Combat Pants are exceptionally comfortable and do not restrict the wearer\u2019s freedom of movement Wagner indicated \u201cThese new combat pants are fitted to the anatomic form and function of the lower body so they feel great and perform fantastically \u201d he said \u201cThe pants move as the wearer moves whether standing sitting kneeling laying walking running climbing or jumping This is possible because of our decision to include stretch panels made from Schoeller\u00ae Dynamic polyamide elastane blend stretch materials and to strategically position them in the most beneficial places \u201d Other important features of the debuting Striker X Combat Pants include \u2022 Ergonomic triple layer knee protection system that adjusts from the rear to provide extra cushioning or impact protection when needed \u2022 No melt no drip construction throughout \u2022 Nearly a dozen pockets of various sizes to allow carrying a greater quantity and variety of essential items \u2022 Built in hooks that fasten the hem to the wearer\u2019s boots so that the pants legs can\u2019t ride up \u2022 Double belt loops that permit a holster to be rapidly attached or detached \u2022 Ability to accept a WINDSTOPPER thermal liner so that the pants can be worn in cold temperatures \u2022 Breathable nylon cotton blend ripstop material throughout enables use in hot weather \u201cWe believe wearers will as soon as they put on a pair of these recognize that our Striker X Combat Pants are a radically different and superior piece of tactical gear \u201d Wagner offered \u201cThese pants are designed with the needs of military units in mind They need combat pants that can go out on a mission and come back home in one piece or easily repair them out in the field if needed We know this because they told us this is what they need And we listened \u201cThe result is a model of combat pants that supplies maximum durability plus go anywhere do anything capability in environments of every imaginable type These pants embody functionality comfort usability and protectiveness \u201cWe are very confident that our Striker X Combat Pants will earn plaudits aplenty from those who wear them They are in our opinion the ultimate combat pants for military operatives \u201d The Striker X Combat Pants will be available in two

so often I dedicate my writing to a topic that is near and dear to my heart raising awareness of employment trends and challenges for military veterans who are transitioning out of the service and back into the civilian world of work A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to attend a conference on this very topic at Amazon\u2019s headquarters hosted by Deloitte and other organizations dedicated to hiring veterans in their organizations as well as organizations that exist to directly provide transition support Part of the day\u2019s events included a presentation by representatives from LinkedIn who shared their latest Veteran Opportunity Report a study using the massive data and insights available to the digital networking platform What is important to acknowledge is that LinkedIn\u2019s positioning as a powerhouse of professional networking puts its teams in a unique position to understand this topic in great detail If you are interested in learning more about this untapped talent pool I encourage you to download their report for yourself In the meantime here are some highlights that might surprise you The quick stats Veterans remain with their initial employers longer than their nonveteran counterparts Veterans are more likely to be promoted than their nonveteran colleagues Veterans are more like to have a graduate degree or higher as compared to nonveterans Veterans with bachelor\u2019s degrees have 9X more work experience than their peers It\u2019s important to note that there are several challenges that transitioning veterans face that can significantly hamper their ability to succeed in the long term once they enter the civilian workforce Inaccurate Understanding Myths About Veterans It is important for anyone with hiring duties or ability to have an accurate understanding of what veterans bring to the table and what challenges this and other underrepresented populations face when it comes to finding meaningful work opportunities Underemployment Trend While the rate of veteran employment has improved due to a laser focus on the topic and support from employers the data suggests that underemployment is a trend that seems to be a real reality for veterans transitioning into the civilian workforce LinkedIn\u2019s findings suggest that the underemployment gap between veterans and nonveterans has dramatically increased over the last decade to approximately Unintended Consequences Underemployment can potentially result in \u201cbrain drain \u201d lower wages fractional use of skill sets lower levels of personal and professional development and higher costs for employers Debunking some myths of hiring veterans As with other underrepresented segments of the U S workforce there are a few common misperceptions that exist that may be impacting your organization\u2019s ability to access talent from this segment of the talent pool The Turnover Myth Veterans have difficultly integrating into the civilian workforce and tend to leave their first employers at a rapid rate Various studies including LinkedIn\u2019s current research shows that the opposite is in fact true Veteran retention rates are higher than their nonveteran counterparts The Mental Illness Myth Many veterans are unable to contribute and succeed in the civilian workforce because they struggle with mental illness This one is really surprising but there are many folks out there who believe that many or most veterans are entering the civilian workforce with mental health issues that prevent them from contributing to their organizations The Culture Myth Veterans are unable to shift their ways of working to be productive in the civilian workforce No doubt the organizational culture in the military is unique and it is unique for a reason Service members have a very serious mission where errors can result in disastrous results Over the years the military has mastered how to indoctrinate train and sustain a fighting force that is capable of protecting our interests To accomplish this they have developed a very unique way of working that enables them to drive consistent and reliable behavior from the members of their services The Experience Myth The time veterans spent serving in the military really doesn\u2019t equate to experience in the civilian world This myth is easy to see in LinkedIn\u2019s research showing that veterans are more likely to take a step back in seniority than their nonveteran counterparts Granted if you haven\u2019t served in the military I can understand that it might be difficult to relate that experience to the civilian workforce but I don\u2019t know too many year olds who are managing employees and millions of dollars of inventory in highly stressful situations with a operational tempo outside of those in the military Though the context is very different the leadership experience that veterans bring to the table is undeniable I recently penned another piece on the \u201c network gap \u201d that exists that creates inequities in people\u2019s ability to develop fruitful networks This network gap can negatively impact many marginalized populations of the workforce and seems to be at play in hampering the civilian work prospects of veterans as well As an entrepreneur I have benefited significantly over the years because of my own military experience Fortunately I understood the importance of developing and cultivating a broad and diverse network within and outside of the military networks that have and continues to serve me well One of the things I really appreciate is the support that I have received from my military network and it has no doubt contributed to where I am today Unfortunately for many transitioning veterans they have relied too strongly on the insular culture of the military to develop extremely powerful networks within that community but have failed to expand those networks out into the civilian world until they begin thinking about their transition At this point by their own behavior or lack thereof many transitioning veterans may be putting themselves squarely into the network gap in ways that have tangible and long lasting effects on their career prospects post military service While some industries have begun to understand the value and potential talent that dwells within marginalized populations like transitioning service members there are still many that have yet to do so in any meaningful way The result is veterans who struggle to gain appropriate professional opportunities and businesses that struggle to fight for talent in the same small talent pools creating a lose lose for everyone", "page_url":

film aged 12: Close Encounters of the Third Kind", "text": "C lose Encounters of the Third Kind is Steven Spielberg\u2019s family sized late 70s UFO drama starring Richard Dreyfuss as a midwestern Joe Schmoe who sees coloured lights in the sky and starts sculpting his mashed potato into the shape of Devils Tower in Wyoming It was at the time Columbia Pictures\u2019 highest grossing blockbuster and it proved the director of Jaws was no flash in the pan Close Encounters was fantastical and mystical and sometimes borderline hysterical And it was for a few years my absolute favourite movie Pauline Kael described it as \u201ca kid\u2019s film in the best sense\u201d and she was absolutely right Except the first time I saw it aged eight or so it seemed impossibly sophisticated gob smackingly profound and as much a guide to the perplexing world of adulthood as it was to the galaxies above our heads It contained messy homes and messy cars and a psychologically messy hero in electrician Roy Neary Dreyfuss who undergoes a Damascene conversion on the backroads of Indiana and returns home a wild eyed zealot to spook his kids at the dinner table \u201cI guess you\u2019ve noticed something a little strange with Dad \u201d he tells them through the tears \u201cIt\u2019s OK though I\u2019m still Dad \u201d Richard Dreyfus as Roy Neary having a Damascene moment Photograph Channel How strange to learn that Spielberg actually wanted Steve McQueen to play the role That would have made it a totally different film \u2013 the tale of a rugged all American turned intergalactic pioneer as opposed to an everyman in mortifying meltdown Obviously Dreyfuss was the more interesting choice He makes Neary grey faced and rumpled and somehow older than his years hot wired by an obsession he can barely put into words and torching his career and his marriage without so much as a backward glance As played by Dreyfuss Neary doesn\u2019t rise to the occasion so much as descend to it digging himself deeper and deeper into trouble before finally slipping down the mountainside to meet the alien mothership In the view of the French government scientist played by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut Roy Neary is a hero In the view of everyone else he\u2019s taken leave of his senses At the time the Devils Tower finale was billed as the film\u2019s big bells and whistles showstopper Viewed today it feels over extended a tiresome piece of prog rock noodling that one is tempted to watch on fast forward But as for the rest well it\u2019s still kind of wonderful a storm of dustclouds and summer crickets and vast star splashed skies I love the breadth and business of Spielberg\u2019s picture I love the din of different languages the cross fire of conversation Robert Altman got there first but I didn\u2019t know that at the time Close Encounters is sunnier and simpler than the other great American films of its era But it contains enough angst and confusion to keep it the right side of sappy The bells and whistles showstopper Photograph Allstar Columbia Rewatching the movie I\u2019m wondering exactly what quality hit me so hard as a child Was it the tantalising prospect of first contact with space aliens Or something smaller knottier and altogether closer to home The first time I saw it would have been shortly after my parents\u2019 divorce These days that feels significant Close Encounters is a film about a dissatisfied young father with one eye on the exit door It also contains a frayed exhausted single mum played by Melinda Dillon who suspects she can\u2019t protect her infant son No doubt this would have sailed over my head at the time but it seems likely that on some level I recognised my parents on the screen \u2013 and caught the faintest fleeting understanding of how their lives were playing out Also Close Encounters painted a compelling picture of planet Earth \u2013 the alien land I\u2019m still trying to figure out to this day Like every childhood favourite it was a formative film a gateway of sorts opening out towards thornier scarier wilder views I remember being especially struck by the scene in which Neary first encounters the extraterrestrials when the power grid fails and the mailboxes start rattling and all the truck\u2019s clutter blows into the man\u2019s face Spielberg made the adult world feel so rickety and impermanent barely tethered to the ground and liable to be torn loose at any second This was terrifying but it was thrilling too It allowed for the possibility for transformation and adventure hinting at a chaotic magic that might be hiding in plain sight That\u2019s probably why I never really liked the film\u2019s ending when Neary is willingly led up the gangplank to the mothership He\u2019s leaving the weird looking mountain and the new friends he has made He\u2019s leaving the backroads the deserts his family the forests He\u2019s leaving the untidy homes messy cars and all those unpredictable people \u2013 and having sat through the film I could never understand why he would Because what was all that if not a comical abundance of riches And who needs the cosmos when you\u2019ve got a world like this one", "page_url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/08/my-favourite-film-aged-12-close-encounters-of-the-third-kind", "label": 1, "score":

the military expertise at EU level to support exchange of information and sharing of best practices among member states\u201d For that a dedicated task force is to be set up within the EEAS structures led by the European Union Military Staff EUMS to \u201ctemporarily support and facilitate information exchange on national military assistance in support of civilian authorities to help fight the coronavirus pandemic \u201d Borrell said The new task force is meant to cooperate with the EU\u2019s Emergency Response Coordination Centre ERCC a core part of the EU\u2019s Civil Protection Mechanism that coordinates the delivery of assistance to disaster stricken countries such as relief items expertise civil protection teams and specialised equipment However it is still unclear when the task force is meant to take up its work \u201cThis will be done in full coordination and complementarity with NATO \u2013 I can assure you that there will be no duplication of work \u201d said Borrell \u201cBut it is important that we Europeans work together to ensure a coordination effort and a mutual support where is needed in full solidarity \u201d As NATO in recent weeks has significantly stepped up its efforts to support its member states in the fight against COVID experts have questioned the EU\u2019s slow practical response on the matter In early April NATO foreign ministers tasked Supreme Allied Commander Europe SACEUR General Tod Wolters with coordinating the air transport of medical equipment and personnel across Europe One of his tasks was to implement simplified procedures for rapid air mobility in coordination with Eurocontrol the pan European civil military organisation dedicated to supporting European aviation using the NATO call sign and clearance for military relief flights Known as Rapid Air Mobility RAM the initiative is part of NATO\u2019s wider so called military mobility effort to boost the deployability of allied troops and assets Before then members largely acted upon their own initiative with the military alliance primarily working to coordinate the acquisition of protective medical equipment through the Euro Atlantic Disaster Relief Coordination Centre EADRCC Asked by EURACTIV whether there are plans to join forces on EU NATO level the EU\u2019s Chief diplomat answered \u201cFor sure this is what it is all about What we have decided is to increase the exchange of information and the coordination between our capacities and the needs required here and there \u201d \u201cThe Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg has been in touch with me to explain their plans and we will cooperate with them according to the requirements arising from this this coordination procedure \u201d Borrell added Asked the same question by EURACTIV NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg confirmed that \u201cNATO and the European Union are complementing each other \u201d \u201cWe have to deal with COVID but at the same time we have to

working to develop therapeutics to help us get through this crisis as quickly as possible and on top of that we continue to maintain our top mission which is making sure the United States remains safe and secure Esper said He outlined his three priorities for the department s COVID response Protecting soldiers sailors airmen Marines civilians and their families Preserving essential mission capabilities to continue defending the American people the United States and its interests abroad and Providing full support to the whole of government response to the pandemic Everyone must do their part to reduce the spread of the virus Esper said We see some light at the end of the tunnel but we re far from being out of the woods \u2026 I urge you to follow the president of the United States day plan and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance to help reduce the spread of the virus the secretary said The CDC recently outlined guidance on face coverings and DOD immediately put out its policy he noted Many of our adversaries \u2026 are trying to exploit this crisis Esper said So it s important that we maintain readiness by full faith and confidence in our commanders DOD will ensure deployed troops receive the support and resources they need to accomplish their critical national security missions he added The secretary pointed out that service members have put their

we will get through this together and we will be stronger and more resilient on the back end Milley said everyone in the military is making a contribution We re going to continue to defend our country he said We re going to continue to provide mission assurance around the world We re also going to continue to protect the American people from the ravages of COVID and we will continue to take care of our troops and our families The chairman offered three pieces of advice One pay attention to the guidance that has been put out by the CDC and the president he said Two use the chain of command We think that information that flows up and down the chain of command has been significant over the last several weeks but we encourage you to continue to use that And third is take care of each other If you see \u2026 someone that is challenged with COVID please speak up help them out and get them to the right medical facility Col\u00f3n L\u00f3pez also outlined his priorities First he said is to

Photo by Salty Dingo Pool via Getty Images Getty Images What\u2019s the most gender balanced military in the world today Israel Why Because it was \u2013 exceptionally born balanced The rest of the Western world\u2019s military systems have been working to integrate women into their entirely male dominated design decades Their attempts capture lessons drawn from eight countries\u2019 militaries Australia Canada Israel Netherlands South Africa Sweden U K and the U S This holds precious insights and fascinating parallels for the business world \u2013 and anyone working to balance heavily male dominated organizations They are pulled together in a fascinating book edited by Robert Egnell Vice Chancellor President at the Swedish Defence University and Mayesha Alam Researcher at Yale entitled Women and Gender Perspectives in the Military An International Comparison I discovered the book while doing some work with one national defense force and I was most struck by the complete replication of issues I\u2019ve been working on in the corporate world for the past years If a bit more extreme \u201cIt\u2019s the final bastion of patriarchy \u201d says Egnell \u201cwhich puts the military at the very heart of gender issues \u201d And it\u2019s key Simply it\u2019s about making militaries adaptable agile forward looking and well suited to meeting the security challenges of the 21st century adds Alam I will summarize a small part of their findings as well as conversations I had with Egnell in two blogs first WHY militaries are gender balancing Second HOW they are going about it Why Change UN resolution addressing the impact of war on women and their possible role in helping assure peace and security was passed in October It \u201cchallenged traditional notions of security \u201d write Alam and Egnell \u201cWho is it for How can it best be achieved \u201d From there started an international push in militaries around the world to gender balance It\u2019s a hugely complex story hard to generalize across such different histories contexts geographies and cultures Nor are the results fully in but the book gives a rare overview of a common evolution towards more gender balance in one of the most challenging sectors of the world And if you can balance there you can balance\u2026 anywhere I\u2019m going to try and extract some transferable takeaways It\u2019s a historic shift which may be further impacted by the military\u2019s extensive involvement in managing the coronavirus crisis around the world One of the key messages of the book and of my work is how you connect gender issues to the mission of an organisation Below are three ways militaries and companies most commonly frame and explain why they are balancing Who sells the why is as important as the message itself says Egnell and equally true for companies Why such a fuss about \u201cselling\u201d the reason for balance Because as management writer Simon Sinek has explained it determines how you design change \u2013 and whether the change \u2018takes\u2019 sustainably The Battle For Equality This approach frames the arrival of women into the military as a human rights issue and part of a broader global push led by the feminist movement to ensure equal rights across human organizations of all kinds though complicated by some feminist perspectives that the military is itself a symbol of patriarchy and needs taking down entirely The problem with this approach say Alam and Egnell is that it is perceived by some to be in direct conflict with the \u2018functional imperative\u2019 of the militaries themselves They believe the military \u201care entitled and indeed need to be different from broader society \u201d The over reliance on equality as a line of argument created substantial backlash and resistance Corporate parallel This is similar to companies and CEOs positioning gender initiatives as \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d and as an ethical imperative first and foremost Over reliance on this theme can create backlashes against widespread perceptions of affirmative action and political correctness The Fight For Effectiveness This approach positions gender balance as a means to unlock enhanced military effectiveness in the field of operations The \u201cmistakes made in Iraq and Afghanistan \u201d brought this home says Egnell \u201cWe couldn\u2019t talk to half the population or body search them \u201d The lack of gender balance in the military meant it was also deaf to early signals warning of the rise of extremism \u201cIf we\u2019d listened to women\u2019s groups in Iraq we would have known much earlier \u201d This is echoed by former U S Ambassador Melanne Verveer and now Executive Director of the Georgetown Institute for Women Peace and Security \u201cThere is a growing evidence based case\u201d she writes \u201cdocumenting the positive difference women\u2019s perspectives and participation make in policy making around conflict prevention resolution and reconstruction This is no longer an option for peace and security but a necessity and it will take leadership to close the gap \u2013 from the highest levels of the UN and the member states \u201d The benefits of balance in this line of reasoning become operational tactical necessity in security intelligence gathering and cultural understanding unit cohesion and providing role models in state and peace building Corporate parallel A minority of companies frame gender balance as a market driven imperative a way of skillfully listening and adapting to feminizing markets \u2013 from cars to whisky This positions it as a business imperative rather than a moral one and tends to better engage dominant male groups Gender balance is no longer optional for most companies and it definitely takes leadership to close the gap The War For Talent The professionalization of armies has led to what The Economist refers to as the gentrification of the military \u201cModern warfare relies less on hordes of expendable infantry and more on sophisticated platforms\u201d it writes and this has put pressure on recruiting enough well qualified people \u2013 especially the particularly sought after STEM types science technical and engineering The military is now often competing directly with some of the best and best paying global companies for skilled talent The gender argument here is that women will enlarge a hotly contested war for talent pool Corporate parallel Companies understand that women are now of global university graduates and if they can\u2019t attract recruit and develop them their own future is at risk This has become the leading argument for balance in the majority of companies In this list concludes Alam and Egnell the most convincing and receivable of the arguments that works with the men who dominate most militaries is the operational effectiveness one They consider the military has one mission to defend the nation and if gender isn\u2019t seen to contribute to that mission it\u2019s nothing but a distraction \u2013 or worse a perceived reduction of its capability The flaw in this argument which Alam Egnell and their co authors challenge throughout the book is the \u201cassumption that armies have reached a pinnacle of effectiveness \u201d I have come to the same conclusion for the same reasons in companies Most highly successful companies are also deeply convinced that they are already finely honed meritocracies If you can\u2019t get the majority to engage with the idea that women might bring added value rather than reduce quality you will never sustainably balance an organization That\u2019s why it\u2019s so crucial to get it right from the start The \u201cwhy\u201d argument leads to HOW militaries address the issue and how much time and effort they are willing to put behind it That\u2019s what I\u2019ll address next How Three ways militaries have implemented balance", "page_url":

post that diverges from my usual nerdy pursuits about Haskelling and maths I\u2019ve spent the last few years working on financial technology in the EU and I felt it was appropriate to write on what I see as a undercovered topic in tech journalism In the last few months Facebook has released what they claim is a new financial services platform called Libra Libra aims to be digital settlement system based on a basket of international currencies that are managed on a \u201cblockchain\u201d and held in a cash pool governed in Switzerland The stated goals of the project are lofty and have massive geopolitical consequences There are many sensible articles written in the Financial Times and New York Times about the unsound monetary and economic assumptions that underlie the proposed financial structure but there aren\u2019t enough technologists who have given their analysis from a technical perspective Not many people who work on financial infrastructure speak publicly about their work and so this project has gotten quite a bit of a pass in tech journalism Financial journalism really needs to do their due diligence on this project as the internals are exposed for the world to see For reference I am referring to the code is open sourced at this Github repository and under the Calibra Organisation What is laid bare for the world to see is an architecturally schizophrenic code artifact claiming to be a new reliable platform for global payment infrastructure Yet the actual implementation diverges from this goal in bizarre ways when one actually dives into the codebase I\u2019m sure there is an interesting story about the internal corporate politics of this project and as such I thought it apt to do some diligence on what I see as a truly strange set of architectural choices that break the entire system and put consumers at risk There is another technical review of this architecture from mcclure111 which comes to similar conclusion about the apparent faux innovation and mental gymnastics this project does to pretend to be a decentralised blockchain when it\u2019s actually just a slow replicated database for shadow banking I won\u2019t pretend to have an objective opinion about Facebook as a company Few people in tech view the company in a positive light anymore Reading through the publications released it is clear there is a fundamental deception in the stated goal and implementation of the project Put concisely this project will not empower anyone It is a pivot from a company whose advertising business is so embroiled in scandal and corruption that it has no choice but to try to diversify into payments and credit scoring to survive The clear long term goal is to act as a data broker and mediate consumers access to credit based on their private social media data This is such an utterly terrifying and dystopian story that should cause more alarm than it does The only saving grace of this story is the artifact they open sourced is so hilariously unsuited for the task they set out to do it can only be regarded as an act of hubris There are several core architectural errors in this project Libra\u2019s byzantine tolerance on a permissioned network is an incoherent design Byzantine fault tolerance is a fairly niche area of distributed systems research that concerns the ability of a networked system to endure arbitrary failures of its components while taking corrective actions critical to the system\u2019s operation Networks that are byzantine tolerant must resist several types of attacks including restarts crashes malicious payloads and malicious voting in leader elections This design decision is central to Libra and it makes zero sense The time complexity overhead from this additional structure varies based on algorithms There is a wide amount of literature where Paxos and Raft derivative algorithms that have been enriched with Byzantine tolerant features but all of these structures come with an additional communication overhead on top of the \\ O n \\ communication cost to maintain the quorum The algorithm chosen by Libra still has a worst case \\ O n \\ communication cost in the case of leadership failure And occurs additional overhead from potential leadership reelections on several types of network failure events For a system that is designed to be run in a consortia of highly regulated multinational corporates all running Facebook signed code and access controlled by Facebook it simply makes no sense to deal with malicious actors at the consensus level Why is this system designed to be byzantine tolerant at all rather than just maintaining a consistent audit log for compliance checks The possibility that a Libra node run by Mastercard or Andressen Horrowitz would suddenly start running malicious code is such a bizarre scenario to plan for and is better solved by simply enforcing protocol integrity and through non technical i e legal means In congressional testimony the product was stated as a challenger to emerging international payment protocols such as WeChat Alipay and M Pesa Yet none of these systems are designed to run on byzantine tolerant pools of validators They are simply designed in the traditional high throughput bus that orders ledger transactions according to a fixed set of rules This is the natural approach to designing a payment system Preventing double spends and forks is simply not an issue that a properly designed payment rails should ever have to deal with by design The overhead from the consensus algorithm serves no purpose and will only limit throughput of the whole system and appears to be there here no reason other than apparently cargo culting public blockchain technology which is not designed for this use case Libra has no transaction privacy By the admission of the whitepaper the system is designed to be pseudononymous meaning the addresses used at the protocol are derived from elliptic curve public keys and contain no metadata about the accounts Yet nowhere in the governance structure description for the organisation or the protocol itself does it indicate how the economic data involved in transactions would be obscured from the validators The system is designed to be a very large way of replicating transactions to a number of external parties who under existing European and US bank secrecy laws should not be privy to the economic details Data policies are difficult to coordinate across borders especially with disparate laws and regulations across jurisdictions having differing cultural views on data protection and privacy The protocol itself is completely open to consortia members by default which is a clear technical design deficiency unsuited to meet the requirements it was designed for Libra HotStuff BFT is not capable of achieving the throughput necessary for a payment rail In the United Kingdom clearing systems like BACs are capable of clearing something on the order of transactions a month While highly tuned systems like Visa are capable of achieving transactions a day The performance of these systems is a function of the size of transactions network routing system load and AML anti money laundering checks For domestic transfers the efficiency problems that Libra tries to solve aren\u2019t really problems in nation states which have modernised their clearing infrastructure in the last decade For retail consumers in the European Union moving money is simply a non issue It can be done simply with a standard smartphone in seconds with traditional infrastructure For large corporate treasury department there are different mechanisms and regulations involved for moving large quantities of money There is no technical reason that cross border payments could also not settle instantly except for the differences in rules and requirements across the jurisdictions involved If the required preventive measures customer due diligence sanctions screening etc are completed multiple times at different steps in the transaction chain this can delay the transaction Nevertheless this delay is purely a function of the governing law and compliance rather than the technology For consumers there is no reason why a transaction in the United Kingdom won\u2019t clear in seconds For retail transactions in the EU they are really only rate limited by KYC know your customer and AML constraints imposed by governments and regulators which would equally apply to Libra payments Even if Facebook were to overcome the hurdles on international money and private data movement the model as proposed is hundreds of person years away from being able to handle global transaction throughput and would likely have to be completely redesigned from first principles Libra\u2019s Move language is not sound The whitepaper makes a bold set of claims about a new untested language called Move which are quite dubious from a programming language theory PLT perspective \u201cMove\u201d is a new programming language for implementing custom transaction logic and \u201csmart contracts\u201d on the Libra Blockchain Because of Libra\u2019s goal to one day serve billions of people Move is designed with safety and security as the highest priorities The key feature of Move is the ability to define custom resource types with semantics inspired by linear logic In the public blockchains smart contracts refer to logic deployed on public networks which allows escrowing laundering money and the issuance of extralegal securities and gambling products These are typically done in a shockingly badly designed language called Solidity which from an academic PL perspective makes PHP look like a work of genius Oddly the new language designed by Facebook seems to have no use case in common with these technologies as it is effectively a scripting language designed for unclear corporate use cases In private distributed ledgers smart contracts are one of those terms that are thrown around by consultants without much regard for clear definitions or purpose Enterprise software consultants generally thrive on ambiguity and smart contracts are the apotheosis of enterprise obscurantism because they can be defined to mean literally anything On the nature of it\u2019s alleged safety we have to look at the language\u2019s semantics Soudness in PLT generally consists of two different proofs called \u201cprogress\u201d and \u201cpreservation\u201d which determine the consistency of the whole space of evaluation rules for the language More concretely in type theory a function is \u201clinear\u201d if it consumes its argument exactly once and is \u201caffine\u201d if it consumes it at most once A linear type system gives a static guarantee that a claimed linear function really is linear by prescribing types to all of functions subexpressions and tracking call sites This is a subtle property to prove and requires quite a bit of machinery to do for whole program analysis Linear typing is still a very academic research area that has inspired uniqueness typing in Clean and ownership typing in Rust There are some tentative proposals for adding linear types to Glasgow Haskell Compiler The claim of the Move language to use of linear types appears to be unsubstantiated by a dive into the compiler as it reveals no such typechecker logic As far as one can tell the whitepaper cites the canonical literature from Girard and Pierce and does nothing of the sort in the actual implementation On top of this the formal semantics of the supposedly safe language are nowhere to be found in either the implementation or the paper The language is small enough that a full correctness proof of the semantics in Coq or Isabelle is tractable Indeed an end to end compiler which did a full proof carrying transformation down to bytecode is quite viable using modern toolchains invented in the last decade We\u2019ve known how to do this since the work of George Necula and Peter Lee all the way back in From a programming language theory perspective the claim that Move is sound and secure is impossible to answer as the claims seem to reduce to nothing more than handwaving and marketing rather than actual proof This is an alarming position for a language engineering project which expects the public to trust it to handle billions of dollars Libra\u2019s cryptography engineering is unsound Building sound cryptosystems is a very difficult engineering problem and a healthy dose of paranoia around cryptography is always the healthy attitude when dealing with dangerous code There are major leaps forward in this space like the Microsoft Everest project building a verifiably secure TLS stack The tools to build verifiable primitives exist today and while expensive to do are certainly not outside the economic capacity of Facebook to build Yet the team has chosen not to on a project stated to be reliable for global finance The libra project depends on several fairly new \u201cwild west\u201d libraries for building experimental cryptosystems that have only emerged in the last few years It is impossible to say whether the dependencies on the following tools are secure or not as none of these libraries have had security audits nor do they have standard practice disclosure policies Several core libraries in particular are indeterminate about their vulnerabilities to side channel and timing attacks The library gets even more experimental and ventures quite outside the Cryptography Standard Model by folding in very novel techniques like verifiable random functions bilinear pairings and threshold signatures These techniques and libraries might be sound but the amalgamation of all of them into one system should raise some serious concerns about attack surface area The combination of all of these new tools and techniques makes the burden of proof much higher It should be assumed this entire crypto stack is vulnerable to a variety of attacks until proven otherwise The \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d model should not apply to cryptographic tools handling consumer financial data Libra has no capacity for consumer protection mechanisms A defining feature of a payment rail is the ability to reverse transaction in case payments need to be undone by legal action or if they result in accidental or system malfunction The Libra system is designed to have \u201ctotal finality\u201d and does not include a transaction type to reverse a payment In the United Kingdom all payments between \u00a3 and \u00a3 are governed Consumer Credit Act This means the payment provider has equal responsibility and liability with the seller if there\u2019s a problem with the items bought or the payee fails to render services There are similar regulations across EU Asia and North America The current Libra design includes no protocol to comply with consumer protection laws and has no clear plan to build one Even worse from an data architecture the finality of the core authenticated data structure based on a Merkle accumulator state admits no mechanism to build this into the core ledger without a redesign of the core The final conclusion one must take away after doing technical due diligence on this project is this simply that it would not pass muster in any respected journal on distributed systems research or financial engineering Before trying to disrupt global monetary policy there is a massive amount of a technical work needed to build a reliable network the public and regulators could trust to securely handle user data I see no reason to believe that Facebook has done the technical work needed to overcome these technical issues in their project not does it have any technical advantage over existing infrastructure that already works Claiming one\u2019s company needs regulatory flexibility to explore innovation is not an excuse for not doing it in the first place",

working out payment plans and using security deposits as a stopgap while directing tenants to the emerging patchwork of local state and federal assistance programs \u201cSix weeks ago you could name your price and you\u2019d have multiple people applying \u201d said Mr Brunner who lives in Minneapolis where he owns and manages duplexes and triplexes across the city \u201cNow you\u2019re deferring and working out payment plans and it\u2019s only going to get worse \u201d One week after the first of the month tenants nationwide are already struggling with rents In interviews with two dozen landlords \u2014 including companies with tens of thousands of units nonprofit developers who house the working poor and mom and pop operators living next door to their tenants \u2014 property owners say their collections have plunged as much of the economy has shut down to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus Daryl Carter chief executive of Avanath Capital a Southern California company with units across the country said his buildings reduced April rents by percent Deidre Schmidt chief executive of CommonBond Communities a nonprofit affordable housing provider with about apartments in the Midwest expects as many as percent of her tenants most of them hourly workers with low incomes to fall behind on their monthly bills Joseph Razavian a part time landlord in Atlanta who works at a software company but owns a duplex and a triplex as investments is bolstering his reserve fund by putting off nonessential maintenance like fresh paint and new rain gutters \u201cThe whole market just changed \u201d said Gustavo Lopez a property manager in the San Francisco Bay Area Nearly million people have filed unemployment claims over the past two weeks It\u2019s too early to gauge how broadly these numbers will translate to the loss of rent Many tenants are within the grace period before their rent is declared late Some can stitch things together for a while by getting deferrals applying their security deposits or paying with credit cards Still early findings suggest that April is looking bad and lend credence to Mr Brunner\u2019s opinion that May will be much worse The National Multifamily Housing Council a trade group for big apartment owners and developers compiled data tracking rent payments across some million units nationwide It showed that through the first five days of April percent of tenants had so far failed to pay their rent compared with percent in the same period a year ago That lined up with surveys released by Apartment List a rental listing service Mynd Property Management and Avail a platform that helps small landlords manage rentals All showed the share of partial or unpaid rent surging to as much as a quarter of billings compared with March or last April Some tenants are simply moving out College students are breaking leases to move home Laid off workers are showing up at rental offices to exchange their keys for their deposits saying they are moving in with family members And there is Terra Thomas a florist in Oakland Calif who could pay her April rent with savings if she wanted but has decided to withhold the she pays for her studio With her usually busy wedding season shaping up to be grim she\u2019d rather conserve her money than pay bills now \u201cThis could last a long time and be really really serious so I don\u2019t want to be asking myself in a few months \u2018Why did I give away my last few paychecks to rent \u2019\u201d she said \u201cI need to know that I can eat and pay for health care \u201d The trillion CARES Act signed by President Trump on March should in theory help laid off tenants keep up with the rent through a combination of expanded unemployment insurance and one time stimulus payments The act also included aid to public housing providers and grants to state governments that could be used for rental assistance But only a sliver of the money deals with housing directly About billion in grants will mostly be given to cities homeless shelters affordable housing providers and states to support people who are homeless and sustain or increase housing assistance There are big gaps in assistance for tenants as well as landlords because almost all of it is directed to renters and owners already attached to some sort of government program For instance much of the aid to tenants is earmarked for those living in subsidized and public housing and much of the mortgage forbearance will benefit landlords whose loans are backed by the government through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or the Department of Housing and Urban Development This is little help to most moderate and low income tenants who live in market rate developments or small landlords whose loans are often held by private lenders and not backed by the federal government Cities and states have tried to address housing troubles by passing eviction moratoriums which should prevent an immediate rise in homelessness but doesn\u2019t resolve what happens in three or four months when tenants who have had little or no income are billed for months of back rent \u201cEventually the moratoriums will be lifted and we don\u2019t want to create an environment where low income renters fall off a financial cliff and we have a rash of evictions \u201d said Diane Yentel chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition an advocacy group in Washington After lobbying for grants to homeless providers in the CARES Act her group is pushing for billion in direct subsidies to tenants The National Multifamily Housing Council has called for similar aid Ms Yentel in an interview cited two objectives to relieve tenants of rent burden but also to support small landlords at risk of foreclosure For several decades the nation\u2019s affordable housing stock has fallen sharply particularly \u201cnaturally occurring affordable housing\u201d \u2014 run down buildings that offer low rents without government subsidy Since much of this housing is operated by smaller landlords Ms Yentel fears that without any aid to landlords the buildings could go into default and be picked up by investors who will renovate them for higher paying tenants after the crisis subsides \u201cOne way or the other we have to get aid to smaller landlords so that the precious affordable housing stock we have still exists on the other end of this crisis \u201d she said According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University a quarter of the nation\u2019s million renter households paid more than half their income in rent in Separate research from the Federal Reserve showed four in Americans would have difficulty covering a sudden expense suggesting that tens of millions of tenants are just a week of missed work away from falling behind on their housing bills For the past four years rent increases have helped stir a nationwide tenant uprising that led to the biggest expansion of tenants\u2019 rights in decades Rent control laws were enacted in New York Oregon and California and tenants organized mass actions like a group of mothers in Oakland who occupied an empty house for two months to protest house flipping Now after years of coordination organizers see the coronavirus pandemic as a galvanizing force Last week the Right to the City Alliance a national coalition of tenant and racial justice organizations held a digital CancelRent rally to call for rents to be eliminated as long as people can\u2019t work Homes Guarantee a national tenants\u2019 campaign has been holding weekly strategy calls On Wednesday a caravan outside US Bank Plaza in Minneapolis honked horns and waved signs to demand rent and mortgage relief \u201cThis is a moment of clarity about a broken system in which million people were already paying over percent of their income on rent \u201d said Tara Raghuveer a tenant organizer in Kansas City and director of Homes Guarantee Ms Thomas the renter refusing to pay in Oakland is a member of the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment an activist group associated with the house occupying mothers For weeks she has been trying to organize her building in a rent strike and has gotten tenants in three other units to join her One is her upstairs neighbor Andrew Yen a data scientist at an agriculture company who still has a job and isn\u2019t worried about making his monthly rent He and Ms Thomas had been discussing some sort of coordinated action but after weeks of job losses and walking around his neighborhood seeing \u201crent strike\u201d posted on telephone poles or spray painted on utility boxes he decided the time was now so he is striking in solidarity \u201cI feel like rent striking is the least somebody

Basic Combat Training on Monday after a two week pause to ensure that the current procedures and capabilities are in place to screen and test our recruits for the highly contagious virus Gen Paul Funk commander of the Army Training and Doctrine Command told defense reporters at a call in roundtable Tuesday Training centers at Fort Jackson South Carolina Fort Benning Georgia Fort Leonard Wood Missouri and Fort Sill Oklahoma have instituted a two plus eight model where new recruits are isolated for a two week period of classroom training before moving onto the more hands on portion of BCT All four of the training centers are doing that to make sure that when the recruits come in we are making sure that we can form the safety bubbles necessary to get us through the training Funk said Related Army Moves to Reopen Basic Training as Coronavirus Cases Emerge at Fort Jackson But many of the Army s professional military education courses designed to build leaders as they rise through the ranks have been forced to shift to online distance learning a concept that Funk and other Army leaders have envisioned for the future force The long term vision has always been to take the training to the soldiers not the soldiers to the training and this virus has actually caused us to focus on that long term vision in a clear and present manner Funk said describing the kind of incredible people we have The Army s Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth Kansas and the Army Sergeants Majors Academy at Fort Bliss Texas have drastically increased their dependence on a virtual classroom setting according to Maj Gen Stephen Maranian the provost of Army University at Leavenworth The students of both courses were just returning from their spring break when the

increased its use of distance learning to roughly based on this COVID pandemic said Maj Gen Hersey commander of the Cyber Center at Fort Gordon Georgia Using distance learning works really well for individual technical work and really many aspects of training and education that would require that type of effort he said But I would also say that this experience has reinforced that distance learning is not the right technique for every learning outcome or every instructional methodology Maranian agreed adding that online courses can never replace traditional classrooms where soldiers and leaders can interact with one another What makes us as good as we are are the courses that bring folks together for an extended period of time in groups that have an opportunity to learn with each

st\u00f6\u00dft schon beim Koalitionspartner SPD auf Widerstand Auf der milit\u00e4rischen Ebene ist allerdings f\u00fcr die Luftwaffe der Ersatz des Tornado in der Electronic Combat Role ebenso entscheidend Die Bundeswehr hat in der NATO zugesagt diese F\u00e4higkeit unter anderem zum Ausschalten der gegnerischen Flugabwehr zur Verf\u00fcgung zu stellen und ist daf\u00fcr auf neue Maschinen angewiesen Die fr\u00fchere Verteidigungsministerin Ursula von der Leyen hatte im Januar entschieden als m\u00f6gliche Nachfolgemodelle den Eurofighter von Airbus sowie den US Kampfjet F A des Herstellers Boeing zu untersuchen nicht aber den modernsten US Kampfjet den F von Lockheed Martin Das Ministerium hatte klar gemacht dass der bruchfreie F\u00e4higkeitserhalt einschlie\u00dflich der Sonderrolle nuklearer Teilhabe ein wesentliches Entscheidungskriterium sei Die F A wird auch als Growler mit der Ausstattung speziell f\u00fcr den elektronischen Kampf angeboten Ob dieser bruchfreie F\u00e4higkeitserhalt f\u00fcr die nukleare Teilhabe m\u00f6glich sein wird h\u00e4ngt vor allem von den USA ab die ein Flugzeug daf\u00fcr zertifizieren m\u00fcssen und da hatte es nicht so gute Signale f\u00fcr den Eurofighter gegeben F\u00fcr den elektronischen Kampf dagegen ist aus Sicht von Airbus der Eurofighter dem US Pendant durchaus gewachsen Die Anforderungen f\u00fcr die bisherige

federal guidelines for reopening the economy which comprise three phases but ultimately defer to governors on when and how to return their states to normal The first phase allows for gradually returning to work while also minimizing non essential travel The second phase allows for gatherings of people and non essential travel The third allows for schools and organized youth activities to open up as well as large venues to operate under \u201cphysical distancing protocols\u201d The third phase also allows bars to reopen but with \u201cdiminished standing room occupancy\u201d when possible The guidelines were unveiled at the president\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing on Thursday Earlier in the day Trump held a conference call with the country\u2019s governors to preview the guidelines Trump said it was essentially up to them to lift their stay at home orders but encouraged them to do so if they saw no apparent health risk a move that contradicted his previous claim of \u201c total authority \u201d to decide if and when a state should reopen Likewise the new guidelines largely defer to governors to decide when to move to each phase The guidelines represent a dramatic shift from the strict stay at home orders currently in place in many states In unveiling them Trump made clear his eagerness to end the nationwide lockdown and return the American economy to its pre coronavirus days \u201cA prolonged lockdown combined with a forced economic depression will inflict an immense and wide ranging toll on public health \u201d Trump said on Thursday He claimed that would include \u201ca sharp rise in drug abuse alcohol abuse suicide heart disease and many other dimensions of physical and mental wellbeing\u201d Trump\u2019s top officials at the briefing stressed that states and governors must be cautious in relaxing guidelines in order to continue the country\u2019s modest progress in containing the virus \u201cWe are slowing the spread we are flattening the curve \u201d said the vice president Mike Pence \u201cIn a word because of the actions of this president this administration governors at every level our healthcare workers and Americans we\u2019ve saved lives and we can be comforted in that \u201d But officials praised the administration\u2019s progress in fighting the pandemic In laying out the first phase of the guidelines Dr Deborah Birx the coronavirus taskforce response coordinator explained that some strict orders would have to stay in place \u201cIf the schools are closed they should continue to be closed \u201d Birx said \u201cGyms could open if they adhere to strict physical distancing \u201d Dr Anthony Fauci the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the guidelines did not mark an immediate end to governors\u2019 coronavirus pandemic responses A \u201clight switch on and off is the exact opposite of what you see here\u201d Fauci said \u201cYou don\u2019t get to phase one until you get through the gating \u201d Trump is optimistic that many states are ready to advance through the guidelines \u201cI think states are in that ballgame \u201d Trump said \u201cNot for opening but I think they\u2019ll be able to open relatively soon I think the remainder are just getting better Look New York New Jersey are having very tough times and they\u2019ll be there They\u2019ll be there at some point But they\u2019re not going to be one of the earlier states They\u2019ll be later obviously \u201d The White House sought support from business leaders and lawmakers ahead of unveiling its new guidelines and Trump spoke earlier on Thursday with congressional lawmakers in both parties The White House also announced a set of senators who would participate on the president\u2019s \u201cTask Force to Reopen America\u201d But governors have indicated that the guidelines may only be a factor in what states decide to do next A few governors even extended their stay at home orders and signed new executive orders on Thursday in response to the pandemic The governors of Michigan Illinois Ohio Kentucky Wisconsin Indiana and Minnesota announced a new partnership for coordinating reopening their states\u2019 respective economies Governors along both coasts have already unveiled similar alliances But other governors praised the president\u2019s new directions \u201cI appreciate President Trump\u2019s guidelines for reopening pieces of the economy that have been closed temporarily \u201d the Nebraska governor Pete Ricketts said \u201cIt is

"title": "New Land Mine Option", "text": "Curtis Hand One of the greatest dangers associated with landmines according to de mining experts in Africa Latin America and Southeast Asia is there are few \u2013 if any \u2013 maps or records about where they are placed meaning in many post conflict theatres there is no way to turn off or safely deactivate conventional mines While international agreements seek to ban the use of landmines and work towards their discovery and removal through various non proliferation efforts the reality is that major arms producing nations such as China Russia and the US continue to manufacture these \u201cdefence on a budget\u201d weapons Almost as a sign of his perceived invincibility US President Donald J Trump seemed to celebrate the collapse of his impeachment with an executive order again allowing the production and export of landmines from the USA Nevertheless accepting the reality that there will always be a need for defence against heavy military hardware and an effective vehicle access denial solution there needs to be a re think about landmines which is what Forcit Oy did The Finnish company is the first to re think how landmines function strictly following international guidelines and adhering to the foundations of the Ottawa Anti Personnel Mine Ban Convention \u2013 to which Finland is a signatory nation Safety Smart The Forcit SENTRY System is a completely new Anti Tank Mine ATM that is programmable radio controlled and features an integrated map function under which it is impossible to lose an ATM According to Forcit the SENTRY System consists of the Control Units CU Communication Link Units CLU and ATMs The SENTRY CU is a hand held tablet with built in map functions and radio communication which enables the user to control the whole minefield it has four main functions Minefield Planning where users are able to plan a minefield with the CU and planning tool using a highly detailed map mine placements are based on coordinates and it is also possible to use references from buildings or other objects from the field Minefield plans can be done in advance and shared over the system to troops before mine deployment Mine Deployment based on the planned minefield troops are able to deploy mines in exactly the right position with the help of the \u201cgo to place\u201d function In case of unexpected obstacles or other reasons troops are able to change the place and register the new position to the system while they can add in new reference points from their surroundings if necessary Minefield Control where troops are able to control mines or entire minefields using the CU the technology for this is based on radio communication and can be performed over several kilometres depending on the number of CLUs Activating deactivating neutralising setting active time and checking active time are activities handled over the radio Minefield History once a mine is deployed and activated to the system its history will be retained so the user can follow a mine\u2019s status and ensure it is neutralised while the history of removed mines remains in the system The SENTRY CLU is an un jammable un hackable radio link unit designed to extend the communication range from the CU to the minefield which is km depending on surroundings though the range can always be extended with additional CLU\u00b4s The SENTRY ATM is a dual charge mine designed to be effective against a wide range of vehicles with the charge part built in two sections The first one to be activated is an EFP for penetrating the vehicle hull and the following one is a bulk charge for giving the shock and pressure effect against the target In addition to built in radio communication and sensors the SENTRY system has extremely good Insensitive Munitions IM properties meaning it is a highly stable mine and will not accidentally \u201cgo off\u201d because of extreme environmental conditions View from the Top When asked about the benefits of their Sentry ATM over conventional \u201cmine replacements\u201d Forcit\u2019s Managing Director Mr Joakim Westerlund clarified \u201c from a safety point of view a radio controlled minefield has many benefits for both civilians and forces With our radio controlled and map function based SENTRY system the benefits are unprecedented and a step change in modern national security and warfare \u201d At War and Peace According to Westerlund forces can remotely control deactivate and neutralise individual mines and whole minefields from a single device so the minefield is active only when necessary and because of the secure geo location functionality of the mines forces have the overview of the whole minefield and the actual activation status of each mine The SENTRY System knows the exact position of deployed mines meaning it is easy to find deployed mines for de mining with the help of coordinates from the map function making it easy to ensure all mines are removed from a minefield Sensors inside the ATM are built to react only to targets it is designed for so all other vehicles animals soldiers and civilians will not be detected as a threat To be lethal the Sentry ATM needs to be placed activated and directly engaged by a heavy armoured vehicle \u2013 again noting the whole SENTRY System is built upon the principles of the Ottawa treaty for which Sentry ATM provides safe fast and easy mine removal The SENTRY system will be available during the second quarter of with the start of series production", "page_url":

unendlicher Datenstrom mit Coroutinen", "text": "Meine Geschichte zu Coroutinen in C geht weiter Heute tauche ich in das Coroutinen Framework ein um einen unendlichen Datenstrom zu erzeugen Konsequenterweise solltest du meine zwei vorherigen Artikel C Coroutinen \u2013 ein erster \u00dcberblick und C Mehr Details zu Coroutinen kennen Das Framework zum Schreiben von Coroutinen besteht aus mehr als Funktionen die du teilweise implementieren oder teilweise \u00fcberschreiben kannst Damit l\u00e4sst sich das Verhalten der Coroutinen sehr feingranular steuern Am Ende l\u00e4sst sich zum Beispiel eine Coroutine erzeugen die einen Generator Generator f\u00fcr einen unendlichen Datenstrom erzeugt Generator getNext int start int step auto value start for int i i co yield value value step Nun habe ich das Ziel des heutigen Artikels vorgestellt Jetzt beginnt die Arbeit Das Framework Eine Coroutine besteht aus drei Komponenten Promise Objekt Coroutinen Handle und Coroutinen Frame Promise Objekt Es wird innerhalb der Coroutine ver\u00e4ndert und gibt ihr Ergebnis mithilfe des Promise Objekts zur\u00fcck Coroutinen Handle Er ist ein nichtbesitzender Verweis der au\u00dferhalb der Coroutine erlaubt die Coroutine wieder auszuf\u00fchren oder zu zerst\u00f6ren Coroutinen Frame Er ist ein interner Heap basierter Zustand Dieser besteht aus dem Promise Objekt den kopierten Argumenten der Coroutine den Anhaltepunkten der Coroutine suspension points und den lokalen Objekten deren G\u00fcltigkeit vor oder nach dem Anhaltepunkt enden Ein vereinfachter Workflow Wenn du co yield co await oder co return in einer Funktion einsetzt wird diese Funktion zur Coroutine Dadurch transformiert der Compiler den Funktionsk\u00f6rper in eine Funktion die die folgende Struktur besitzt Promise promise co await promise initial suspend try catch promise unhandled exception FinalSuspend co await promise final suspend steht f\u00fcr den urspr\u00fcnglichen Funktionsk\u00f6rper Der vereinfachte Workflow besteht aus den folgenden Phasen Die Coroutine startet ihre Ausf\u00fchrung Der Coroutinen Frame wird allokiert Alle Funktionsparameter werden in den Coroutinen Frame kopiert Das Promise Objekt promise wird erzeugt Der Aufruf promise get return object erzeugt den Coroutinen Handle der in einer lokalen Variable gespeichert wird Das Ergebnis des Aufrufs wird an den Aufrufer zur\u00fcckgegeben falls die Coroutine angehalten wird promise initial suspend wird mithilfe von co await ausgef\u00fchrt Das Promise Objekt gibt std suspend never f\u00fcr eine Coroutine zur\u00fcck die sofort ausgef\u00fchrt wird und std suspend always f\u00fcr eine Coroutine die erst auf Bedarf lazy ausgef\u00fchrt wird Der K\u00f6rper der Coroutine wird dann ausgef\u00fchrt wenn co await promise inital suspend fortgesetzt wird Die Coroutine erreicht einen Anhaltepunkt Der Coroutinen Handle promise get return object wird an den Aufrufer zur\u00fcckgegeben der die Couroutine fortsetzt Die Coroutine erreicht co return Sie ruft promise return void f\u00fcr co return oder co return expression auf falls expression den Datentyp void besitzt ruft promise return value expression f\u00fcr co return expression auf falls expression nicht den Datentyp void besitzt zerst\u00f6rt alle auf dem Stack erzeugten Variablen ruft promise final suspend mithilfe von co await auf Die Coroutine wird zerst\u00f6rt co return eine nicht gefangene Ausnahme oder durch den Coroutinen Handle Sie ruft den Destruktor des Promise Objekts auf ruft die Destruktoren der Funktionsparameter auf gibt den Speicher der Coroutine wieder frei gibt die Ausf\u00fchrung an den Aufrufenden zur\u00fcck Jetzt gilt es die Theorie in die Praxis umzusetzen Ein unendlicher Datenstrom mit co yield Das folgende Programm erzeugt einen unendlichen Datenstrom Die Coroutine getNext verwendet co yield daf\u00fcr getNext erzeugt einen Datenstrom der mit start beginnt und auf Anfrage jeweils den um step

Coroutine gen2 von bis Bevor ich den Workflow genauer vorstelle m\u00f6chte ich mithilfe des Compiler Explorer und des GCC die Ausgabe des Programms pr\u00e4sentieren Die Zahlen im Programm infiniteDataStream cpp stehen f\u00fcr die Schritte in der ersten Iteration des Workflows Erzeugt den Promise Ruft promise get return object auf und speichert das Ergebnis des Aufrufs in einer lokalen Variable Erzeugt den Generator Ruft promise inital suspend auf Der Generator ist lazy und pausiert damit automatisch Fr\u00e4gt nach dem n\u00e4chsten Wert und gibt zur\u00fcck ob die Werte des Generators bereits konsumiert sind Wird durch co yield angesto\u00dfen Danach ist der n\u00e4chste Wert verf\u00fcgbar Fordert den n\u00e4chsten Wert an In weiteren Iterationen werden nur die Schritte bis wiederholt Es ist anspruchsvoll das den Coroutinen zugrunde liegende Framework zu verstehen Der einfachste Zugang ist es meines Erachtens mit existieren Coroutinen zu experimentieren und ihr Verhalten zu beobachten Die vorgestellte Coroutine die einen unendlichen Datenstrom erzeugt ist ein guter Startpunkt f\u00fcr deine Experimente Verwende dazu den Link auf das ausf\u00fchrbare Programm

based runway aircraft Also the carrier group could get out of harm s way quickly enough as enemy planes and ships were anticipating such an attack and had positioned vessels at sea to spot U S warships The bombers also lacked radar Although the Soviet Union was a U S ally against Germany it had signed a nonaggression pact with Japan so it declined an offer to participate To get within range of Japan the plan was to sail the carrier USS Hornet within miles of mainland Japan launch the aircraft with a crew of airmen and quickly sail out of harm s way along with the carrier Enterprise a cruiser eight destroyers and two oilers However when the task force was miles from Japan they were spotted by a Japanese patrol vessel which the cruiser USS Nashville promptly sank However the patrol vessel had time to radio a warning to the Japanese military so the decision was made to launch the B 25B s immediately and get out of the area as quickly as possible Six hours after launch the aircraft bombed military and industrial targets in Tokyo and other large cities on the main island of Honshu Of the planes crash landed in China and one aircraft which was low on fuel landed in the Soviet Union which was closer Crew members from that plane were detained because the rules of neutrality were such that the men couldn\u2019t be returned However they all managed to escape In total three crew members were killed in action Another three were executed by the Japanese and one died in captivity This was considered a relatively low fatality rate for such a risky mission One of the survivors Doolittle received the Medal of Honor in from President Franklin D Roosevelt One of those who was captured by the Japanese Army 2nd Lt George Barr was treated horribly while in custody and at one point was near death After the war and after recovery he returned to Japan as a missionary serving there for years The Doolittle Raid while doing relatively minor damage to Japan did serve to greatly boost the morale of the American people which was the primary aim", "page_url":

Sre\u010dko Zajc Global crises such as the spreading of the novel corona virus COVID hybrid threats and asymmetric warfare require civil military interaction responses guided by a unity of aim approach to build up capacity for successful conflict transformation No single activity has a monopoly on responses All of society is required to act collaboratively in replying to demands placed on it by emerging threats We ask What can civil and military leaders and operators responding to crises hybrid threats and asymmetric warfare learn from medical approaches to disease prevention and intervention Like the drunk looking for lost keys under the streetlight because the light is better there irrespective of the fact that they were dropped in the dark lot across the street we often fail to search for answers in places because of the dark We seem content to continue doing what is comfortable not what is required We also question what crisis response actors medical experts politicians civil protection volunteers etc can learn from military responses to confronting complex and potentially dangerous situations And more generally are we looking into the face of ignorance lack of will and hidden agendas supported by those who might profit the most from different crises or is it simply a lack of a systematic approach we may call it comprehensive at national and international levels for example EU NATO UN Lastly how do crisis management curricula and pre crisis exercises fail at all levels of education Violent conflict is a disease though disease is not violent conflict per se Violence as a disease may develop into limited or wide spreading violent conflict when gun cultures prevent governments and citizens from acting intelligently and crafting healthy public policy for instance Needed are creative responses to emerging threats ones that recognize the need for comprehensive approaches in eliminating the many manifestations of violent conflict We must develop new proactive operational paradigms to address conflict and cease reacting to violence Clearly to find the correct answers to complex problems it is necessary to ask the proper questions A wrong hypothesis will only arrive at a wrong conclusion Our goal in this paper is to focus on developing the right questions that will lead to theory informed answers regarding new and emerging roles for military forces in responding to crises hybrid threats and asymmetric warfare In the end conflict analysis and resolution theory must be integrated into higher education professional development trainings exercises and useful apps for use by the general public in responding to emerging threats To act in a concerted unity of aim approach individuals and organizations must have access to timely research and education regarding crisis response Thinking outside of the box has become a well worn phrase meant to help individuals and organizations imagine new and innovative ways to build security and peace in a world subjected to increasing asymmetry Blocking new ways forward however is that we often unthinkingly search for answers within a closed system We assume a finite set of responses We remain in the box while trying to think outside of it This can result in our doing little more in crises than rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic when what is required is a better ship If we choose to be guided by closed system thinking we must accept there is little reason to ask the military what their answer is to current and future national security and defense questions nor should we only ask civilians We will need to accept there are only a finite range of responses and nothing more We do not believe this should be the way forward Our addition to the discussion of addressing crises hybrid threats and asymmetry is that we need to engage open systems thinking where the number of potential responses to threats are limited only by our imagination knowledge and intellectual curiosity In this paper we question if military and non military operators are educated and trained properly to address threats and engage in coordinated responses as well as what might be the role of civil society governments Non Governmental Organizations NGOs International Organizations IOs and Governmental Organizations GOs in meeting future crises Are they educated trained and able to work together collaboratively and cooperatively Can they interact positively in a constantly chaotic fragile and dynamic operational environment Needed is a profound as well as nuanced understanding of security and the potential for the transformation of a health crisis for example as well as other hybrid threats into asymmetric warfare Is asymmetric merely the opposite of symmetric warfare or is it different in kind If asymmetric warfare is simply the reverse of symmetric than existing asymmetric responses should be enough the opposite of symmetric That has not proved the case The numbers of special operating forces employing asymmetric methods now comes close to the number of conventional forces Are we prepared to address asymmetry with asymmetric approaches to defense and security thereby building an asymmetric fortress How are resilient and anti fragile systems forms of asymmetric offense and defense Is it more useful to focus on the current state as continuous a condition of permanent crisis and global chaos or look to creation of future sustainable states able to battle against crises and hybrid threats in asymmetric environments Is globalization a sustainable model of how we should run our Planet Does globalization result in more or less borders on the ground between states in governance systems and in understanding the living environment As for many phenomena today which we do not fully understand crises hybrid threats and asymmetrical warfare cannot escape our desire for certainty in searching for options even conducting experiments so we can write down the most comprehensive simple and understandable definition of threats If we can t agree on a definition how we can agree on solutions And most frightening are hybrid threats always the first stage of asymmetric warfare or only an announcement of it Can hybrid threats later develop or transform into something different Throughout this paper we examine the relationship of hybrid and asymmetrical threats Considering the fluid nature of hybrid threats and the need for asymmetric responses to ill defined crises is it more useful to replace end state with an understanding of the current state as continuous a condition of permanent crisis and global chaos Have we entered a state of conflict without conclusion The era of classic rigid industrial warfare is over War and peace are not divided they are the same side of the same coin The binary approach that viewed war and peace as two sides of the same coin war on one side flip the coin and \u2018voila\u2019 peace on the other is obsolete The borders of war and peace are blurred and we cannot think only in terms of \u2018battles\u2019 The Third Millennium military way of thinking and preparing no longer fits our needs If there is no war classically defined and the battlefield is a permanent condition incorporating cooperation competition and conflict there is nothing to \u2018win\u2019 Employing old intellectual paradigms in this condition we all lose Our experience teaching civil and military crisis preparedness at university level and in professional military education settings as well as working in civil military interaction environments suggests military thinking has atrophied In the past research for defense purposes invented and resulted in many side products useable later in civilian non military contexts microwave for example but today civilian companies are the most progressive and the military is using more and more civilian products as a part of its military tool set Internet AI laser and so on Public private partnerships are the way forward as civil and military merge to fill a military intellectual gap that continues to widen Some military thinkers and politicians seem to suggest all that is needed is to push a button and the military way of thinking and operating will be reset We do not think this is the case If we fail to change our thinking and move outside of the intellectual constraints imposed by an overwhelming bureaucracy whatever we reset will simply get us more of the same in a different order It is better to think in a new way we must recycle our way of thinking and operating even if the risk is that we do not know exactly what will come out Needed is at least the courage of Alice when she stepped into the Looking Glass Crises with limited as well as global impacts and hybrid threats are daily normal conditions Threats short of conventional war are redefining its character General Rupert Smith is unequivocal in his observation that \u201cwar no longer exists\u201d Today war is not consigned to clearly demarcated battlefields where uniformed militaries engage in combat governed by agreed upon rules of war Smith further notes conflict now occurs amongst the people where the \u201cdynamic of confrontation and conflict rather than war and peace are at the heart for war\u201d The hybrid battlefield is everywhere Traditionally war has been the province of the state as it held a monopoly on violence Clark States today have lost their monopoly and a result is that military leaders must now develop new responses for addressing crises hybrid threats and asymmetric warfare First however military leaders ought to understand the changes Military leaders appear anchored to a Clausewitzian understanding of war where political and military are distinct spheres A Westphalian Model is regularly employed to analyze and explain asymmetric warfare a model that is proving to have limited utility as \u201cfewer and fewer wars involve conventional clashes of opposing armies\u201d Levy Thompson Outdated analysis tools are used to try and understand ill defined amorphous virus like hybrid asymmetric threats Military effectiveness has primarily been determined on how conventional forces fared in interstate conflicts Cleveland et al Victory defined in this manner is antiquated Smith\u2019s new battlefield can be seen in the refugee crisis confronting the European Union EU Beginning in massive numbers of refugees began to flow into the EU The crisis has had the effect of disrupting the EU and some member states of the NATO alliance contributing to an escalation of internal disagreements to the point where some have begun to question the utility of the EU and NATO What bad actors could not achieve through kinetic action they accomplished though the weaponization of refugee populations metaphorically expressed as biological weapons Refugees present the military with a new challenge one that cannot be dealt with by kinetic means The only available option is political Refugees as hybrid threat have left the military on the sidelines primarily providing policing activities Political and military leaders have been slow to recognize refugees as a hybrid threat An overreliance on power as determinative can cause military leaders to struggle in attempting to understand the profound changes impacting responses to asymmetric hybrid threats where we have entered an era of war without conclusion Naim Military organizations\u2019 conservative and risk averse nature can lead them to resist necessary changes Clevealnd et al Civilian and military actors are obliged to develop a competency in recognizing and understanding the hybrid threats that now characterize a boundless operational environment The battlefield is no longer hemmed in by geography Technology has extended the physical fight into the cyber and space realms Human and technological networks dominate Networks not military formations are the new organizing structure for hybrid conflict Ferguson It is necessary to embrace this new paradigm hybrid threats as network war where there is no immediate announcement or recognition of a military attack conflicts manifest themselves without any sign or warning We recognize hybrid threats as we are experiencing them Hybrid threats carry the potential to become asymmetric conflicts they behave as living organisms that replicate themselves throughout an unbounded battlefield demonstrating a fractal nature Hybrid threat activities develop their own logic and move toward an internal congruence The threat manifests itself at each level of the military structure \u2013 tactical operational strategic and political \u2013 differently yet the same To understand a hybrid threat it can be useful to think of broccoli The smallest floret and the bunch replicate the same pattern at each level of analysis A \u201cself similarity\u201d develops Gadlin et al To combat hybrid threats it is necessary to detect analyze and systematically disrupt the self replicating pattern Unconventional warfare is no longer only a shadow activity State and non state actors conduct operations cyber media and fake news classical propaganda free trading disruption freedom of movement small green men paramilitary organizations and many others using hybrid means when power relationships are unequal and the consequences of force on force engagements are too great The cost benefit analysis has tipped to the unconventional It is not obvious nor is it necessary that hybrid threats will evolve into asymmetric warfare As all adversaries are different the determining factor is their goals and competing agendas as well as human technical and economic resources Resilience speaks to a systems ability to recover from a shock to quickly get back on its feet so to speak The military has a renewed interest in resilience as a key coping strategy Jermalavi\u010dius Parmak Discussions around resilience should extend to include the need for fluidity Late in the 20th century \u201cnimbleness and flexibility became increasingly valuable\u201d Na\u00edm Flexible suggests systems capable of bending under stress and not breaking Flexibility is only good enough in network war Networks must develop the capacity to flow with hybrid threats using their energy to build network wide responses Fluid non kinetic conflict management approaches that \u201cembrace the chaos in a unity of aim self organizing systems approach to peacebuilding\u201d are required Maty\u00f3k Stauder To successfully transform crises and hybrid threats it is not necessary to develop asymmetrical warfare capacity nor even limited war responses it is essential to build anti fragile political and military networks as well as general public warning systems This approach moves beyond resilience Resilience relies on building systems that can absorb a shock and recover In contrast Taleb outlines a need for development of anti fragile systems \u2013 systems that embrace shocks and use the energy to make systems stronger Military networks ought to become anti fragile in meeting hybrid threats and develop into dynamic complex adaptive systems \u201ca scale free network\u2026a web without a spider\u201d Ferguson To build resilient Whole of Society structures is daily work and it needs to be done in advance of threats through Joint Civil Military Interaction JCMI preparedness During crises systems are pushed to improvise and improvisations do much better when they adhere to already established algorithms of resilience Resilient anti fragile systems are the answer to crises hybrid threats and asymmetric warfare The question is Are military networks capable of becoming anti fragile without networking with non military specialists Most military decisionmakers have shown little need to transform an Industrial Age military mindset to one that is adept to deal with a flattened and dynamic digital world Calls for change do not endanger the rigid sturdy military system Change can be viewed as an opportunity or a threat and many military leaders have learned to be risk averse It is important to recognize that crises and hybrid threats are nothing new It is a return to the future Interstate industrial war is an outdated model Smith Business like approaches to war are being replaced by conflict entrepreneurs where violence is a hybrid cottage industry Conflict analysis and transformation as part of Joint Civil Military Interaction JCMI employing a unity of aim approach Maty\u00f3k Stauder to achieve a harmony of effort ought to become the primary non kinetic response to hybrid threats Presently education and training schemes regarding Civil Military Interaction CMI are inadequate leaving military actors ill prepared to confront hybrid threats that have no kinetic response This is not to suggest that classic military capabilities are no longer needed only that our understanding of the military and requirements placed on military actors have changed The military is now one tool among many in conducting Whole of Society responses to crises hybrid threats and asymmetric warfare For kinetic responses the military remains the best option The military can establish a safe and secure environment within which humanitarian aid and development actors can function Special operations forces fast moving logistical support medical support and engineering are capacities that civil society are unable to replicate When it comes to kinetic and disaster response the military maintains an unmatched economy of scale But the military is incapable of leading and implementing an entire comprehensive approach We should not forget that more and more civilian companies are contracted by the military For instance transportation of military assets is routinely provided by civilian companies The COVID response is a painful acknowledgement that a new fast reacting well coordinated complete body of actors at national and international levels is needed Conflict resolution methodologies have to become part of a JCMI tool kit Negotiation mediation and facilitation are tools for combatting crises hybrid people centric network battle and war Maty\u00f3k Schmitz We should not underestimate the influence of strategic communication and information timely delivered to the general public involved in crises Unfortunately even though there is need for new approaches to address emerging forms of conflict we remain ill prepared For instance \u201cNATO personnel are lacking awareness of CMI\u201d and they are unable to effectively engage non military actors positively van der West Warstat A myopic focus on kinetic operations continues irrespective of the observation of how the military engages regularly with local civilian actors in non kinetic engagements Davidson Gezari Increasingly military actors find themselves involved in the political sphere percent of the time and employing the remaining percent of their time in kinetic operations Gezari The complex nature of crises and hybrid threats makes them a challenge to understand vis \u00e0 vis conventional war Possibly it is useful to borrow from the medical community in working to understand hybrid asymmetric warfare and thereby move out of the intellectual box that can restrict our thinking Cleveland et al quotes Janis Berzin when discussing Information Warfare as an aspect of the asymmetric battle For Berzin \u201cThe Russian view of modern warfare is based on the idea that the main battlespace is in the mind and as a result new generation wars are to be dominated by information and psychological warfare with the main objective being to reduce the necessity for deploying hard military power to the minimum necessary making the opponents military and civilian population support the attacker to the detriment of their own government and country\u201d see Learning to Distort The Evolution of Information Warfare in Russia\u201d Possibly it is useful to imagine the new battlespace as a social body where diplomacy information security forces and economics interact Peacebuilders approach the social body as a physician approaches a patient they conduct a diagnosis make a prognosis and apply a therapy or intervention Rather than meeting asymmetric hybrid threats with direct military force alone CMI actors address violent conflict as a social virus using therapeutic means treating the patient holistically The current novel coronavirus COVID is a threat to global health and at the same time is a teacher teaching us that without a global scientific approach research and a unity of efforts no one wins At the moment we do not have enough information regarding COVID to see the whole picture We are confronted with incomplete information and disinformation We must wait and avoid speculations The novel corona virus and the more familiar yearly flu virus have no respect for national borders just as hybrid threats and networks do not recognize borders it is progressing in a fast moving world adapting to its specific environment Systems states societies and individuals must adapt too and they need to reinvent and develop a value regrettably forgotten in the last decades solidarity Solidarity is needed in minimizing the living space of a virus the virus must have a host unfortunately selfishness is expanding to meet the pandemics size In this instance large portions of populations refuse to take COVID seriously The global community must be called to action civil and military There can be no hangers on The paradigm \u2018war on terror\u2019 must be replaced with \u2018solidarity to everyone\u2019 Crises limited or pandemic size and hybrid threats that operate like or as viruses must be met with whole of society responses Cultural religious ethnic differences are minor when facing global existential threats that endanger life and show no respect for social differences dividing individuals The smallest denominator is \u2018basic life\u2019 or \u2018human rights\u2019 if you prefer Human Security and National Security are two sides of the same coin Asymmetric hybrid threats infect the social body and when left untreated can affect the DNA of a society Social structures become addicted to violence and conflicts become intractable Violence becomes part of a society\u2019s DNA Hybrid threats can be understood as social viruses that live off their hosts gaining strength as host bodies seek to develop an immunity The hybrid threat as virus adapts to changes in the social body It is a dynamic activity The idea guiding civil military intervention should be bringing the social body to a state of wellness The treatment plan should be holistic It cannot be military centric When a physician treats a patient he or she treats the whole patient physical emotional and spiritual Responses to asymmetric hybrid threats cannot be no less focused Societies have physical emotional cultural and spiritual dimensions A pathology in any one dimension impacts the others Joint Civil Military Interaction JCMI could be the most progressive adaptable and useful tool available to civil authorities and the military in tackling hybrid threats and providing humanitarian assistance and disaster response to crises Employing a CMI way of thinking civil and military actors harmonize their efforts in complex operational environments to ensure the meeting of human needs and continuation of national security objectives national and human security merge A CMI way of thinking is the goal where civil and military act out of their expertise and complement each other Competition is anathema to CMI Collaboration cooperation and complementarity C3 are the process and the goal Time is the most critical resource when executing humanitarian assistance and disaster crisis response operations The CMI mindset is built upon a common language or grammar Agreeing to and using settled upon terms and definitions facilitates C3 and speeds joint problem solving and joint decision making Agreed upon conflict resolution processes expand the amount of time available to civil and military actors Operational delays resulting from a misunderstanding of terms in use with no conflict resolution structure in place can result in unnecessary confusion among individuals and agencies To better manage the time available in complex operations planners and operators require new ways of thinking and acting Bureaucratic stovepipe responses to fast moving chaotic complex and complicated situations is no longer acceptable The Joint Civil Military Interaction Network provides a structure within which the CMI mindset is made manifest The JCMI Network brings civil and military actors as well as scholars together to investigate issues impacting civil military interaction in peacekeeping and humanitarian actions JCMI is based on communication planning and coordination among international national and local non military representatives and military leaders before during and post crisis to facilitate mutual effectiveness and efficiency of each The purpose of JCMI is to construct a new way forward in addressing crises hybrid threats and asymmetric warfare Its goals are to Establish and strengthen partnerships among JCMI actors Build international cooperation Inform and educate policymakers regarding JCMI and Promote public policy initiatives that advance JCMI within peacekeeping and humanitarian response communities The JCMI Network offers a way forward JCMI is a humanoid algorithm flexible enough to adapt as fast as possible in meeting new kinetic and non kinetic threats conventional hybrid and asymmetric \u2013 providing real time advice to military and non military actors regarding conflict analysis resolution and transformation As a network JCMI has the capacity to provide tailored responses based on need Off the shelf responses that are not context driven can have limited utility and are not part of the response set rather subject matter experts can \u2018swarm\u2019 to address specific needs in context Strategy and tactics are developed case by case A response network is developed It may appear as though we are suggesting that addressing crises hybrid threats and asymmetric warfare is like coping with the spread of disease and that is correct When confronting the spread of disease it is important to move fast to bring experts together who are capable of collaborating and freely exchanging information in building capacity to respond In a civil military interaction context \u2018fight\u2019 is not exclusively used as a military term It describes concerted action in the same way we speak of \u2018fighting climate change\u2019 \u2018fighting coronavirus\u2019 and \u2018fighting for peace\u2019 The world is flat and military organizations are vertical hierarchical The non military organizations are horizontal more flexible Conflict between two horizons can lead to slow bureaucratic thinking and inadequate responses when quick action is needed The military can default to what it knows best kinetic responses We must invent responses that are appropriate to the demand and comprehensive Joint Civil Military Interaction is now the best option we have to develop References Cleveland Charles Jensen Benjamin David Arnel Brynat Susan

They were responsible for authoring the III MEF CONPLAN to protect all U S forces their families and Defense Department personnel in Japan They are both retired Marine lieutenant colonels As former lead operational planners for the Biohazard Defense Contingency Plan for all military service members their families and Defense Department employees in Japan we noticed the strong possibility of a COVID pandemic in early February of this year There are lessons to be learned from an earlier viral outbreak In response to the H5N1 or bird flu outbreak in President George W Bush issued a National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza PI that November Thirteen days later Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen Peter Pace issued a planning order PLANORD directing all combatant commanders to conduct execution level planning for a DoD response to pandemic influenza The guidance was clear and broad Develop a contingency plan that specifically addressed the three major missions of force health protection defense support for civil authorities and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief As leaders of the planning efforts we recruited medical experts and researched preventive health materials from the World Health Organization Centers for Disease Control National Institute of Health and disease exposure control studies from the Center for Strategic and International Studies This month planning effort included tabletop exercises with State Department officials and local government officials and resulted in a page biohazard response plan for all Marine Corps forces in Japan The plan also involved the additional major mission of continuity of operations to ensure that local governments and military installations continued to provide essential and emergency services during a pandemic The plan required all units and critical support agencies and businesses to classify their employees or service members as nonessential essential or emergency essential personnel The lessons we learned in this comprehensive planning effort are extensive but they have not been fully implemented in response to COVID So what can policymakers emergency medical responders and today s planners learn from our plan Expect a new normal until a proven vaccine is developed Social distancing measures and restrictions on mass gatherings must continue until the population has been vaccinated and the current COVID virus is no longer a threat Just like we adapted to the post terrorist attacks by instituting new security measures we must also adapt to the pandemic by continuing social distancing measures until a proven vaccine has been developed tested and administered to the entire global community We must do this to avoid subsequent pandemic waves Our plan operated under the advice from health experts that a vaccine may take about a year to develop and that it will take months more for it to be readily available to the entire population We recommend that the vaccine be prioritized and allocated first to medical responders and other personnel designated as emergency essential responders Local public health experts should draft immunization plans to include the prioritization of immunizations to emergency essential personnel The public should expect to experience additional shortages of medical equipment We ve seen the shortages of N95 masks ventilators and ICU beds in hospitals however when restrictive measures are eased or lifted our planning revealed that there will be a huge demand for infrared thermal detection systems IR thermometers in order to conduct public health febrile surveillance especially prior to boarding flights or mass transportation The post pandemic environment will most likely involve febrile screenings to ensure viral threats are contained Ongoing surveillance and contact tracing are extremely critical after the first pandemic wave is contained to a manageable level in order to prevent a second wave or spreading it to another region We should leverage technology in our smartphones to self report if we have been in contact with infected people China successfully implemented these protocols in Wuhan province through a phone app The demand for mortuary services may exceed available capacity Additionally new protocols must be established for conducting funerals Public Service Announcements are critical to shape public action to comply with evolving restrictive measures implemented by public health officials Additionally PSAs alleviate fear and anxiety by providing reassurance and critical educational material to assist the public in helping to contain and reduce the pandemic Simply stated PSAs help to reset the expectations of the evolving crisis and the associated escalatory or de escalatory restrictive measures A pandemic may produce a second wave after the first outbreak and sometimes even a second cycle outbreak after a few seasons This is due to previously undetected pockets of viral outbreaks a lapse in compliance to restrictive measures the reintroduction of the virus from an external source or the possibility of the virus mutating gradually by antigenic drift or abruptly by antigenic shift It is important for medical responders public officials and the public to understand that we must not let our guard down when we start seeing a reduction in the transmissibility of the COVID virus or a reduction in the number of people infected We cannot lean on unfounded messages of hope rather we should look to science and condition based assessments to decide when to ease or lift restrictive measures The message to policymakers and high ranking preventive health officials is clear Demand science based justifications for lifting restrictive measures For all that have closely tracked the evolution of this COVID virus from its initial outbreak to a pandemic the writing on the wall is obvious National leaders made grave mistakes by not taking the threat seriously The lack of early mitigation has now cost us more than sick Americans more than deaths and more than trillion Our nation is paying a terrible cost for not taking this pandemic seriously enough early enough We must act in earnest to implement these lessons to help contain the viral spread so we can safely ease the restrictive measures while preventing a second pandemic wave or subsequent pandemic cycle The opinions

capable of being fired from a mm grenade launcher researchers say on the heels of a patent filed last month There are two variants of the Grenade Launched Unmanned Aerial System or GLUAS one is a is a small paragliding system with folding blade propellers and Mylar paragliding wings to help it stay in the air and the other is a helicopter style that hovers on a gimbaling set of coaxial rotors said John Gerdes a mechanical engineer with ARL The GLUAS is a small projectile millimeters in diameter can cover a long distance with a gun launching system The breakthrough he said is with how miniaturized autonomous flight hardware has become The drone has a kilometer range with a projected battery life that could top minutes and is capable of operating up to feet in the air according to researchers After launching the drone spreads its wings and soars at a fixed airspeed controlled by ground troops with a joystick or handheld device On the drone a camera is equipped to provide a video feed to a ground station below \u201cIn battle there are multiple scenarios of when Soldiers would use this technology \u201d Gerdes said \u201cHow it\u2019s used depends on which theater they\u2019re operating in \u201d For example on the mountain ranges of Afghanistan if Soldiers found themselves under sniper fire they could deploy the drone to check over the area and determine the enemy\u2019s location The lightweight GLUAS drone is designed to increase Soldier lethality by giving them a bird\u2019s eye view of the battlefield he explained and will easily integrate into most kits carried by Soldiers in the field \u201cThis device provides an autonomy and intelligence platform to help Soldiers perform useful missions while having a lookout from hundreds of feet in the air \u201d Gerdes said \u201cThis integrates modern types of intelligence \u201d \u201c GLUAS is aligned with Army modernization priorities \u201d said Hao Kang another mechanical engineer with ARL \u201cWe\u2019re trying to provide capabilities to individual Soldiers The most exciting part of this is the viability of this platform coupled with its gun launched deployment capabilities \u201d \u201cThings like GPS receivers and flight controllers are very feasible to install onto the GLUAS which makes it easy to maintain a position or follow a ground unit \u201d Gerdes said \u201cBasically if there is something you want to look at but you have no idea where it is yet that\u2019s where the drone comes in \u201d Although they\u2019re making technological breakthroughs at ARL the scientists aren\u2019t working on the same timelines as other developers Kang said \u201cWe\u2019re here to develop innovative concepts for the warfighter\u2019s needs which generally means we bring the size and weight down of a device and push up the range and lethality \u201d Gerdes said \u201cAt ARL we\u2019re typically focused on the basic innovation and discovery aspects of research \u201d

said Lt Gen Jon T Thomas during a telephone press briefing today Since March C 17s have delivered three and a half million swabs on seven missions with the seventh mission arriving last night in Memphis Tennessee The eighth mission is scheduled for arrival in Memphis today he said bringing another half million swabs AMC will continue to fly those missions as long as the command is tasked to do so by U S Transportation Command Thomas said Our national response to COVID is an all hands on deck effort and Air Mobility Command is doing its part to support this fight Air Force Lt Gen Jon T Thomas deputy commander Air Mobility Command Medical supplies aren t the only thing AMC is transporting Thomas said While most Americans who are overseas return to the U S via commercial aircraft AMC does have a role there too \u2014 especially for those who are stuck overseas due to coronavirus Recently and with the approval from the secretary of defense AMC transported Americans back to the United States from Colombia and Panama Thomas said These resubmissions bring the total number of Americans returned by AMC gray tail organic airlift missions to more than since March Thomas said AMC is also responsible for flying other missions in support of the nationwide effort to combat the COVID pandemic For instance he noted AMC was at least partially responsible for moving gear needed to set up field hospitals on both U S coasts AMC C 130s flew equipment and personnel to help establish Army field hospitals in New York and Washington state that will provide additional medical capacity in those areas he said We ve got air mobility liaison officers that are helping to coordinate those movements as well as commercial air movements totaling nine missions transporting tons of cargo and hundreds of personnel to those locations To maintain a global mobility capability Thomas said AMC has taken steps to ensure the safety and health of personnel \u2014 including staff maintainers and air crew Thomas said AMC has a variety of missions that are all influenced by local conditions and situations Both installation and wing commanders within AMC he said have been empowered to take the actions needed to protect their force and the missions required of them It s really important for everybody to understand how valuable the secretary of defense s guidance is on allowing local commanders to make decisions on how to best protect the force Thomas said Some of those actions he said include limiting the movement of certain service members using staggered shifts telework and implementation of health protection condition Charlie which means there is sustained community transmission at all AMC installations Efforts also include medical screening temperature checks and other measures for both air crew and passengers Our national response to COVID is an all hands on deck effort and Air Mobility Command is doing its part to support this fight Thomas said Through our active

creative\u201d in its response to the coronavirus pandemic In particular Rep Adam Smith D Wash wonders whether the military could use its diverse set of contractors to make desperately needed COVID

developing new technology or weapons for unexpected situations on the battlefield \u201cI would love to use that logistical innovative problem solving approach that DoD uses to this problem \u201d Smith said \u201cWe re talking about a disease and theoretically that s more CDC and FEMA but the scale that we re dealing with here is something that DoD I think could be could be a big partner in that \u201d Smith pointed to the military\u2019s rapid acquisition of tens of thousands of armored MRAP trucks in to better protect troops in Iraq from roadside bombs \u201cWe don t need to mass produce an MRAP or a tank or an aircraft carrier we need to mass produce a cotton swab We ought to be able to figure that out \u201d Smith said \u201cI would love to find ways to use existing structures within DoD to take a leadership role in that \u201d Smith said the military could help jumpstart production of other urgently needed supplies as well He also said he\u2019s exploring ways of legislating \u2014 through the under construction National Defense Authorization Act \u2014 ways the military could do more in its coronavirus response \u201cDoD shouldn t necessarily be producing this stuff for every civilian to use \u201d Smith said \u201cBut if they took the lead on producing it \u2014 so that the DoD has what they needed \u2014 that could also spur\u201d commercial \u201cdevelopment later on \u201d In recent weeks the Air Force has flown million test swabs to the United States from Italy where they are manufactured Smith acknowledged that the Defense Department and National Guard \u201care doing quite a bit \u201d Nearly National Guardsman are supporting individual states the Army Corps of Engineers are setting up field hospitals in hard hit regions Navy

opportunity to create a new service your energy passion and expertise will be critical to our success Related These Air Force Missions Are Transferring to the Space Force The sixth and newest military service which was signed into existence by President Donald Trump on Dec is now operating with the aid of some airmen detailed on a temporary basis from what was formerly known as Air Force Space Command Although individuals were assigned in December the May opening includes the physical act of commissioning into the U S Space Force Gen David DT Thompson vice commander of Space Force said Thursday Enlisted members would re enlist directly into the Space Force he said during a webinar hosted by Space News Thompson said Air Force space operators who request a transfer will more than likely be accepted into the Space Force Jobs including space operations 13S and space systems operations 1C6 are considered organic space career fields That s about to people he said The transfers are set to begin Sept If airmen in those career fields decline transfer into the Space Force they can work with their chain of command to examine other options to include applying for retraining into another Air Force specialty applying to crossflow into the Guard or Reserve or applying for separation or retirement if eligible the release states In the meantime those service members will remain in

specialties will begin transfer on Feb it adds Guardsmen and reservists who are already executing space missions and currently aligned with the Space Force will continue supporting it officials are weighing how best to incorporate them A Space Force Reserve component is still being determined the release states The application window will close May Thompson stressed the specific initiative so far is targeted for the Air Force Soldiers sailors and Marines may have to wait a little longer until the Air Force completes its initial transitions he explained There is a general authority for all members of other services to always ask to cross commission that s an authority that already exists Thompson said But before the Space Force actively engages with the Army and the Navy we need to make sure through the secretary of defense through the joint chiefs of staff and through the leaders of the services how we re going to take that approach and who should be eligible to be directly asked or not That s work that still needs to be done he said Airmen who believe they are eligible but do not receive an email to apply should contact the Total Force Service Center or the Air Force Personnel

statements\u2014\u201cUsability is good \u201d \u201cProfitability is good \u201d\u2014is that they introduce the element of prioritisation I like design principles that can be formulated as X even over Y It\u2019s not saying that Y is unimportant just that X is more important Usability even over profitability Or Profitability even over usability Design principles formulated this way help to crystalise priorities Chris has written about the importance of establishing\u2014and revisiting\u2014priorities on any project Prioritisation isn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be a one off exercise The changing needs of your customers the business environment and new opportunities from technology mean prioritisation is best done as a regular activity I\u2019ve said it many times but one on my favourite design principles comes from the HTML design principles The priority of consitituencies it\u2019s got \u201cpriorities\u201d right there in the name In case of conflict consider users over authors over implementors over specifiers over theoretical purity Or put another way Users even over authors Authors even over implementors Implementors even over specifiers Specifiers even over theoretical purity When it comes to evaluating technology for the web I think there are a number of factors at play First and foremost there\u2019s the end user If a technology choice harms the end user avoid it I\u2019m thinking here of the kind of performance tax that a user has to pay when developers choose to use megabytes of JavaScript Mind you some technologies have no direct effect on the end user When it comes to build tools version control toolchains \u2026all the stuff that sits on your computer and never directly interacts with users In that situation the wants and needs of developers can absolutely take priority But as a general principle I think this works User experience even over developer experience Sadly I think the current state of \u201cmodern\u201d web development reverses that principle Developer efficiency is prized above all else Like I said that would be absolutely fine if we\u2019re talking about technologies that only developers are exposed to but as soon as we\u2019re talking about shipping those technologies over the network to end users it\u2019s negligent to continue to prioritise the developer experience I feel like personal websites are an exception here What you do on your own website is completely up to you But once you\u2019re taking a paycheck to make websites that will be used by other people it\u2019s incumbent on you to realise that it\u2019s not about you I\u2019ve been talking about developers here but this is something that applies just as much to designers But I feel like designers go through that priority shift fairly early in their career At the outset they\u2019re eager to make their mark and prove themselves As they grow and realise that it\u2019s not about them they understand that the most appropriate solution for the user is what matters even if that\u2019s a \u201cboring\u201d tried and tested pattern that isn\u2019t going to wow any fellow designers I\u2019d like to think that developers would follow a similar progression and I\u2019m sure that some do But I\u2019ve seen many senior developers who have grown more enamoured with technologies instead of honing in on the most appropriate technology for end users Maybe that\u2019s because in many organisations developers are positioned further away from the end users whereas designers are ideally being confronted with their creations being used by actual people If a lead developer is focused on the productivity efficiency and happiness of the dev team it\u2019s no wonder that their priorities end up overtaking the user experience I realise I\u2019m talking in very binary terms here developer experience versus user experience I know it\u2019s not always that simple Other priorities also come into play like business needs Sometimes business needs are in direct conflict with user needs If an online business makes its money through invasive tracking and surveillance then there\u2019s no point in having a design principle that claims to prioritise user needs above all else That would be a hollow claim and the design principle would become worthless Because that\u2019s the point with design principles They\u2019re there to be used They\u2019re not a nice fluffy exercise in feeling good about your work The priority of constituencies begins \u201cin case of conflict\u201d and that\u2019s exactly when a design principle matters\u2014when it\u2019s tested Suppose someone with a lot of clout in your organisation makes a decision but that decision conflicts with your organisations\u2019s design principles Instead of having an opinion based argument about who\u2019s right or wrong the previously agreed upon design principles allow you to take ego out of the equation Prioritisation isn\u2019t easy and it gets harder the more factors come into play user needs business needs technical constraints But it\u2019s worth investing the time to get agreement on the priority of your constituencies And then formulate that agreement into design principles", "page_url": "https://adactio.com/journal/16811", "label": 1, "score": "210705_news_168328"}, "210705_news_148738": {"page_id": "210705_news_148738", "title":

his laboratory at the University of Florence I picture it as a botanical utopia a place where flora is respected for its awareness and intelligence where sensitive mimosa plants can demonstrate their long memories and where humans are invited to learn how to be a better species by observing the behaviour of our verdant fellow organisms But because we are both on lockdown we Skype from our homes Instead of meeting his clever plants I make do with admiring a pile of cannonball like pods from an aquatic species on the bookshelves behind him \u201cThey\u2019re used for propagation \u201d he says \u201cI am always collecting seeds \u201d Before Mancuso\u2019s lab started work in plant neurobiology was largely seen as a laughable concept \u201cWe were interested in problems that were until that moment just related to animals like intelligence and even behaviour \u201d he says At the time it was \u201calmost forbidden\u201d to talk about behaviour in plants But \u201cwe study how plants are able to solve problems how they memorise how they communicate how they have their social life and things like that\u201d Flower power Mancuso\u2019s team has shown that Mimosa pudica can retain learned information for weeks Photograph Alamy Mancuso and his colleagues have become experts in training plants just like neuroscientists train lab rats If you let a drop of water fall on a Mimosa pudica its kneejerk response is to recoil its leaves but if you continue doing so the plant will quickly cotton on that the water is harmless and stop reacting The plants can hold on to this knowledge for weeks even when their living conditions such as lighting are changed \u201cThat was unexpected because we were thinking about very short memories in the range of one or two days \u2013 the average memory of insects \u201d says Mancuso \u201cTo find that plants were able to memorise for two months was a surprise \u201d Not least because they don\u2019t have brains In a plant a single brain would be a fatal flaw because they have evolved to be lunch \u201cPlants use a very different strategy \u201d says Mancuso \u201cThey are very good at diffusing the same function all over the body \u201d You can remove of a plant without killing it \u201cYou need to imagine a plant as a huge brain Maybe not as efficient as in the case of animals but diffused everywhere \u201d One of the most controversial aspects of Mancuso\u2019s work is the idea of plant consciousness As we learn more about animal and plant intelligence not to mention human intelligence the always contentious term consciousness has become the subject of ever more heated scientific and philosophical debate \u201cLet\u2019s use another term \u201d Mancuso suggests \u201cConsciousness is a little bit tricky in both our languages Let\u2019s talk about awareness Plants are perfectly aware of themselves \u201d A simple example is when one plant overshadows another \u2013 the shaded plant will grow faster to reach the light But when you look into the crown of a tree all the shoots are heavily shaded They do not grow fast because they know that they are shaded by part of themselves \u201cSo they have a perfect image of themselves and of the outside \u201d says Mancuso When corn is nibbled by caterpillars the plant emits a distress signal that lures parasitic wasps to exterminate them Science struggles to view plants as active and motivated because its outlook is so humancentric he argues One test for self awareness in animals is whether they can look in a mirror and understand that they are looking at themselves \u201cVery few animals are able to do this \u201d says Mancuso \u201cHumans dolphins a few apes and probably elephants This has been taken in recent years as a kind of evidence that just these few groups of animals have self awareness \u201d Mancuso believes this is wrong \u201cMy personal opinion is that there is no life that is not aware of itself For me it\u2019s impossible to imagine any form of life that is not able to be intelligent to solve problems \u201d Another misconception is that plants are the definition of a vegetative state \u2013 incommunicative and insensitive to what is around them But Mancuso says plants are far more sensitive than animals \u201cAnd this is not an opinion This is based on thousands of pieces of evidence We know that a single root apex is able to detect at least different chemical and physical parameters many of which we are blind to \u201d There could be a tonne of cobalt or nickel under our feet and we would have no idea whereas \u201cplants can sense a few milligrams in a huge amount of soil\u201d he says Far from being silent and passive plants are social and communicative above ground and beneath through their roots and fungal networks They are adept at detecting subtle electromagnetic fields generated by other life forms They use chemicals and scents to warn each other of danger deter predators and attract pollinating insects When corn is nibbled by caterpillars for example the plant emits a chemical distress signal that lures parasitic wasps to exterminate the caterpillars A slower pace of life Old Tjikko in Sweden is almost years old Photograph Lars Johansson Getty Images iStockphoto Plants respond to sound too \u201cfeeling\u201d vibrations all over \u201cPlants are extremely good at detecting specific kinds of sounds for example at 200hz or 300hz \u2026 because they are seeking the sound of running water \u201d If you put a source of 200hz sound close to the roots of a plant he says they will follow it There is no evidence that the human voice benefits plants although talking to plants may soothe the humans doing it Another reason we overlook plants\u2019 intelligence is their vastly slower pace of life In Mancuso\u2019s new book The Incredible Journey of Plants we meet the world\u2019s oldest plant \u2013 Old Tjikko \u2013 a red fir tree whose roots have writhed in the Swedish earth for about years We are also introduced to the ingenious seeds of crimson fountain grass which choose not to germinate until the conditions are perfect \u2013 and can survive for six years while waiting The main thrust of the book is that plants were the original pioneers and have been forever exploring the planet Mancuso eschews the notion of \u201cnative species\u201d and prizes so called invasive species above all else \u201cThe more invasive they are the more I like them because they are the most brilliant example of the ability to solve problems \u201d he says \u201cInvasive species are the most beautiful plants that I can imagine \u201d For Mancuso \u201cmigration is one of the most important forces of nature All living organisms migrate We are the only species that is not allowed to and this is completely unnatural \u201d Although new generations of botanists are increasingly embracing plant neurobiology Mancuso still has his detractors Last summer a group of eight plant scientists wrote in the journal Trends in Plant Science that Mancuso and his colleagues \u201chave consistently glossed over the unique and remarkable degree of structural organisational and functional complexity that the animal brain had to evolve before consciousness could emerge\u201d Mancuso says that almost all of these botanists are retired \u201cIt\u2019s an older generation of plant scientists that is completely against any notion of a plant as intelligent or behaving For them plants are kind of a semi living organic machine \u201d All living organisms migrate We are the only species that is not allowed to and this is completely unnatural The notion that humans are the apex of life on Earth is one of the most dangerous ideas around says Mancuso \u201cWhen you feel yourself better than all the other humans or other living organisms you start to use them This is exactly what we\u2019ve been doing We felt ourselves as outside nature \u201d The average lifespan of a species on Earth is between 2m and 5m years \u201cHomo sapiens have lived just years \u201d he says \u2013 and already \u201cwe have been able to almost destroy our environment From this point of view how can we say that we are better organisms \u201d Perhaps we should try \u2013 ahem \u2013 taking a leaf out of the plant kingdom\u2019s book Human societies and organisations are structured like our bodies \u2013 with a brain or a top level control centre and various different organs governing specific functions \u201cWe use this in our universities our companies even our class divisions \u201d says Mancuso This structure enables us to move fast physically and organisationally but it also leaves us vulnerable If a major organ fails it could scupper everything and top down leadership rarely serves the whole Plants by contrast \u201care kind of horizontal diffusive decentralised organisations that are much more in line with modernity\u201d Take the internet the ultimate decentralised root system \u201cLook at the ability of Wikipedia to produce a wonderful amount of good quality information by using a decentralised diffused organisation I\u2019m claiming that by studying plant networks we can find wonderful solutions for us \u201d Or take the ethos of cooperation Plants say Mancuso \u201care masters of starting symbiotic relationships with other organisms bacteria mushrooms insects even us Just look at the way they use us to be transported all around the world \u201d We may think we have the upper hand but plants may beg to differ The

about people getting locked out of their Google accounts If you are anything like me half of your digital life is stored in Google Losing access to all this data would be traumatic at best In this article I\u2019m researching what happens when you forget your password or lose your phone What information will Google want to know about you and how can you best prepare for this situation so you don\u2019t lose access to your account completely I\u2019ve been using the same Google account for the last years And to be honest I\u2019ve never changed the password and never turned on the Step Verification because I was afraid that I\u2019ll lose my phone or forget my password and I won\u2019t be able to access my account any more I think this is not sustainable so let\u2019s have a look at what happens when you forget your password or you lose your phone Google is using the following two steps to authenticate you 1st step Password mandatory To prove that it is really you you need to provide Google with a text password 2nd step You phone optional Google uses different means SMS notifications authenticator app to enable your phone to uniquely identify you On top of that it\u2019s possible to use Security keys or keys generated by your password manager but for simplicity we\u2019ll use the phone example This approach combines something you know password with something you have phone to make it much harder for someone to impersonate you e g by tricking you to enter a password into a fake log in dialogue Turning on Step Verification First you can relax Step Verification can be turned back off When you follow the steps in Google\u2019s guide you get asked which of the following options would you\u2019d like to use Notifications Prompts to your Android phone Security Key USB stick like device e g YubiKey SMS and Phone calls I choose notifications for convenience Then Google asks whether I\u2019d like to use a backup number in case you lose my phone But if I lose my phone my number is gone too since I always use prepaid I chose to get backup codes instead They are single use codes that are more versatile than a phone number Tip Store your backup keys in your password manager so if you don\u2019t have your phone on you you can still log in Account recovery when you can\u2019t prove it is you You lost your phone and your dog ate your backup codes Or you are having soap opera level amnesia and you don\u2019t remember your password How do you access your Google account Now you are going to end up with the dreaded Google Account Recovery The algorithm used by google to evaluate your identity is not openly known Here are the things Google will want to know from you What is the last password you remember Do you still have access to your mobile devices Your recovery phone Your recovery email Answer to your security question deprecated Request for providing additional details in writing e g when you created your account if you are travelling Now if you answer all of these sufficiently and ideally from the same browser and IP address that you usually use you are going to get a link to a page where you reset your password If you don\u2019t answer these questions well enough Google won\u2019t grant you access to your account and it recommends that you forget about it and start a new one We couldn\u2019t be sure that you\u2019re the owner To

your recovery information up to date I\u2019m not sure how all these recovery options affect the security It seems to me that if you provide too many ways how to reset your account\u2019s password it makes it easier for someone else to do it as well Prepare for the worst The way I understand it if you get to the \u201cAccount recovery\u201d phase you can\u2019t be certain that you are going to get your account back Most likely having your recovery email and phone up to date is going to be enough but what if your IP looks really suspicious for some reason trip to Thailand maybe One of my other Google accounts actually have been inactive for so long that Google doesn\u2019t trust me when I enter the password and there\u2019s no way to recover There is one more option for super paranoid people Backup all your data For all things I dislike about Google they do give you a full access to your data Visit Google Takeout to back up all your data locally for me it is 8GB of email that I\u2019m interested in This approach brings its own risks I\u2019d strongly recommend encrypting the backup otherwise you have a big portion of your online life lying in a plaintext on your hard drive

Jacob Javits Convention Center learned that a veteran had died of COVID at the field hospital there they knew what they had to do That veteran deserved military honors and they resolved to make sure this former service member received what was due At p m Sunday April with five minutes warning they made that happen When the hearse arrived to collect the remains of the man who once wore his country\u2019s uniform Pardi and Cady quickly organized an escort turning out Soldiers Sailors Airmen and Marines and civilians for an honor cordon and conducted a dignified transfer of remains ceremony at the building Sixty people stood at attention and saluted as the impromptu honor guard made its way to the waiting hearse Cady and Pardi\u2019s unit the Headquarters Company of the 104th Military Police Battalion is currently serving as staff for the Unified Command Center that the New York National Guard staffs to help run what the military has dubbed the Javits New York Medical Station Inside the massive convention center National Guard Soldiers and Airmen active duty and reserve military medical forces and a host of federal state and city officials have created an alternative care hospital that has treated COVID patients The 104th MP Battalion was to be in Germany and Poland participating in a NATO exercise But when deployment to Europe was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic the Kingston based battalion deployed to New York City instead Before Sunday\u2019s event the senior leaders at the Javits Center had already thought about what to do if a veteran in the hospital\u2019s care died explained Sgt Major Robert Jenks Jenks a member of the New York Army National Guard\u2019s 53rd Digital Liaison Detachment is serving as the sergeant major for the Incident Command The senior NCOs coordinated with Sgt 1st Class James Tate from the Army\u2019s 44th Medical Brigade to come up with the protocols to follow when a veteran died They also coordinated with the chaplains who work in the facility to make sure they would be part of the event It was also important to make sure there was a casket flag available when the time came Jenks said He coordinated with American Legion Post in Dutchess County Eric Breen the commander and Al Andrews past county commander ensured that flags were delivered within hours Jenks said The plan was in place when the veteran died April \u201cThe senior NCOs in the building had received notice that a veteran had passed the day prior and were actively in the loop as to where he was and where he was going \u201d Pardi said But because of the high number of COVID deaths the funeral home that was due to pick up the body could not say when they would be able to arrive \u201cWe were notified with very little time to prepare \u201d Pardi recalled When the time came they moved quickly to put together the dignified transfer ceremony Pardi and Cady hustled out of the command center toward the loading bay They notified Staff Sgt Nicholas Mancuso the chaplain\u2019s assistant to notify the chaplain on duty They passed the word as they headed for the loading docks Kevin Clark the New York City Office of Emergency Management representative spread the word to the civilians at the center They pulled out their cellphones and coordinated with hospital staff and the funeral home\u2019s driver as they moved They reached the loading bay with a few service members in tow and determined that the transfer of the remains had not occurred Army Maj Ivan Arreguin chaplain for the 44th Medical Brigade joined the group and they worked out the details Meanwhile word had spread and more people were assembling \u201cWhile we began to hastily put together a ceremony on the ground floor Sergeant Major Cady and I began to notice the crowd growing \u201d Pardi recalled \u201cBefore we knew what had happened the detail of four or five had grown to at least \u201d Everyone that had heard of the ceremony made his or her way to the loading area They stood in silence as they watched the service members disburse and put their plans into motion All services of every stripe and color were represented Members of every office city state and federal had dropped what they were doing to come bid farewell to someone they never met New York City Emergency Medical Services EMS personnel whose ambulances where used to move patients stopped and took part They lined up along the path They waited silently Chaplain Arreguin started the ceremony by stepping forward The others in the procession fell in place with the medical staff flanking the gurney holding the deceased Two Army colonels guarded the deceased while Pardi held the flag and followed Their path took them beside loading bays before turning into an honor cordon of service members and civilians standing at attention rendering salutes Arreguin stopped a few feet before the hearse He turned smartly and waited for Pardi to place the American flag at the foot of the deceased Arreguin conducted a short simple service a farewell to a veteran that no one in attendance knew \u201cIt felt like I was participating in the burial of an unknown soldier known only by God \u201d Arreguin said \u201cIt was solemn respectful honoring and with the key elements normally performed at a military funeral \u201c he added When he had finished Pardi lifted the flag slowly reverently and clasped it to himself \u201cBeing less than ideal for what it was I hope we did the service member justice \u201d Pardi said The medical staff then bundled the deceased into a covering for hygienic travel and placed him in the transport hearse As the door closed the procession had turned about face and began the trek back toward the bays

and swimming pools remain shut For the rest they improvise They hone their fencing footwork in their Colorado Springs Colorado backyard shoot laser pistols at a target in a nearby park yes they

their siblings Isaksen\u2019s older sister Margaux qualified for her third Olympic Games Elgeziry\u2019s brother Omar who now serves as their coach also made the Egyptian squad After Rio Elgeziry and Isaksen were each unsure about how much longer they wanted to remain in the sport It was a financial challenge illustrated by Isaksen working at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods until two weeks before the Rio Games began \u201cBut we both decided we still have a lot to accomplish in the sport \u201d Isaksen said They joined the Army months apart in Both were selected to be members of the World Class

Training Center \u201cEven if we\u2019re training less on the sports side we\u2019ve got to stay ready on the Army side of things \u201d said Isaksen who grew up in Fayetteville Arkansas as a runner before she followed her sister into modern pentathlon \u201cBut with five sports to train for we\u2019re kind of used to it \u201d On most days they begin the morning with a distance run along the neighboring trails After that the routine really does vary There\u2019s a lot of training ground to cover since modern pentathlon competitions consist of fencing freestyle swimming meters equestrian show jumping and a final event combining laser pistol shooting and cross country running four meter laps with five shots after each lap They have their fencing equipment at home so they head into their backyard to work on technique \u2014 over and over \u201cIt gets boring \u201d joked Elgeziry who was a swimmer growing up before being lured into the sport by an older brother Emad who competed at the Games Sometimes they practice laser pistol shooting in their backyard Other times they head to a local park where the couple can more closely simulate race conditions They set up a stand to hold their laser pistols and position a target about meters away They\u2019ll run a loop before returning to shoot at the target Their drills used to draw stares but \u201cthe people in the park are used to us now \u201d Isaksen said Staying in swimming shape with no pools open has proven to be an obstacle They go through dry land workouts made up of core and strength exercises using a medicine ball and bands As for equestrian practice they were riding at their coach\u2019s stable until recently when it was shut down to comply with local ordinances \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to make do

has a long and complicated history with the U S military Our island state\u2019s strategic Pacific location render us valuable for national security purposes and many residents here at least tolerate if not embrace the military presence for its contributions to the economy But the relationship between the U S military and the state\u2019s interests must be a symbiotic one of mutual respect a shared goal for public health That\u2019s why the military\u2019s cloak of secrecy that recently came down about coronavirus cases is disturbing The directive from Defense Secretary Mark Esper stops public disclosure of military COVID cases at the local level saying operational security could be compromised Only national daily totals from each services would be disclosed \u2014 but no details on individual unit base or combatant commands That lack of public transparency is counter to information that we as a community should know in our collective efforts on social distancing to keep the coronavirus at bay Lawmakers on both state and national levels are rightly pushing back \u201cTransparency is important in building trust during a public health crisis \u201d said U S Sen Mazie Hirono \u201cI think it would be appropriate for the military to report positive COVID cases by service in each state \u201d While the state Department of Health does receive the localized military counts to fold into Hawaii\u2019s daily tallies the public doesn\u2019t know those numbers or where they are On Friday the Star Advertiser reported from a \u201cU S official\u201d that just over of Hawaii\u2019s coronavirus cases through Thursday are military members dependents or military civilians Public knowledge of military numbers is needed to help quantify local efforts said state Rep Amy Perruso \u201cThat\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at the curve \u2014 and if their military curve is spiking we need to know that \u201d The military here contributes to Hawaii in a big way via service branch members dependents and military civilians They are interwoven into our island community children in Hawaii\u2019s schools working together in job hubs such as the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard shopping at the Px or Nex exchanges As has been said repeatedly We are all in this together The military is an integral part of Hawaii\u2019s community Just as it would help us all to know about a cluster of cases in say Hawaii Kai so it would be useful to know of such a cluster around Hickam Area specific mitigations such as quarantines could come into play to contain spread for instance Pre emptive strikes are most effective with optimal intel The U S military should know this better than anyone in armed warfare or against a dangerous coronavirus", "page_url":

Joint Strike Fighter aircraft in the Pacific The 354th Fighter Wing at Eielson Air Force Base Alaska accepted its first two Lightning II aircraft Tuesday The aircraft are already gearing up for joint training alongside their stealth fighter cousin the F Raptor also stationed in the region according to a service news release When you station the F at Eielson and you have the F Raptor down at Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson working together in the Joint Pacific Alaska Range Complex with our 18th Aggressor Squadron and ground training assets you have the perfect training field for the F to develop said Col Benjamin Bishop commander of the 354th Fighter Wing Establishing the F 35s in Alaska has been a yearslong process but marks the first step in a journey that will continue at Eielson Air Force Base for decades to come Bishop said in the release Related Did F Testing for Extreme Weather Conditions Fall Short A total of conventional takeoff and landing versions of the F are scheduled to arrive by December The base also has KC Stratotankers and F Fighting Falcons which often serve as aggressor air or red air training aircraft to simulate air to air battles with jet fighter counterparts Eielson hosts one of the Air Force s premier exercises Red Flag Alaska bringing pilots and ground troops together several times a year for the purpose of enhancing tactics and techniques should friendly forces come under siege We have a new mission Bishop said in the release We won t look back as we pioneer the airpower frontier By Alaska will be home to one of the highest concentrations of fifth generation aircraft operating in the Pacific theater and near the Arctic circle In an Op Ed featured in Defense News last year then Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson and Chief of Staff Gen David Goldfein outlined the strategic importance of the F in the region amid the growing international interest in the Arctic stating that Alaska would become home to more advanced fighter jets than any place on Earth Almost a decade before the Japanese invaded the Aleutian Islands Gen Billy Mitchell advocated building airfields telling Congress Whoever holds Alaska will hold the world they wrote Even then the Arctic was strategically important and Mitchell s words underscored the role of airpower in the region Today technological advancements by potential adversaries are making this once forbidding border increasingly porous Adding more U S jets to the region also presents an opportunity for allied nations to integrate and learn from American pilots officials have said For example last year Norway marked the first major exercise for its F 35A variant by participating in the biennial Arctic Challenge exercise in the high north a term used for the region encompassing the Nordic countries and the Arctic alongside U S F pilots The U S Air Force is a huge reinforcement or potential We are not enough said Svein Efjestad policy director for the department for security and policy operations at Norway s Ministry of Defense Speaking to Military com last year prior to the exercise Efjestad said that pairing with the U S would bring volume tactical training and advancement Norweigan officials at the time said they would welcome more interoperability flights with the U S to mix and match capabilities especially when allied militaries could learn more about Russia s expanding activities in the region including GPS jamming and how to thwart or manage hostile action The Air Force deployed F 35s to the Pacific for the first time in during a rotation

COVID global pandemic With COVID mitigation measures affecting many things they have not stopped the squadron from being Fight Tonight ready The always ready mindset reminds us that no matter what is going on we must always be ready to perform our job and Attack said Air Force 1st Lt Matthew Dorsey a pilot with the 25th Fighter Squadron It also emphasizes the importance of following the applicable mitigation measures to ensure that we keep ourselves healthy and everyone we come in contact with is safe The biggest reward of our sustained operations through COVID has been taking the A 10s to the Pil Sung range and shooting the gun Dorsey continued There isn t a better sound than hearing the A cannon s Brrrrrtttttt after you spent all weekend social distancing The professionalism and expertise in the squadron has sustained our operations and allowed us to be flexible Flexibility is the key to airpower The squadron embraces this flexibility but with a twist While balancing risk mitigation with maintaining the Fight Tonight attitude members of the squadron follow the strict guidelines set by U S Forces Korea and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by greeting each other with elbow bumps and encouraging Pil Sung second hand washing techniques Within the Draggins Dorsey explained finding ways to insert the squadron s number into normal conversation and activities is considered a demonstration of witty intelligence Failure to use them in any circumstance is lightheartedly considered poor form Whether huddling during weather briefs stepping to their jets or

refuelling system A3R for its A330 Multi role Tanker Transport MRTT which the company has tested with a Portuguese F and claims is the first in the world This was part of a testing campaign where a total of flight test hours and dry contacts were achieved with the A3R system over the Atlantic Ocean covering the entire airborne refuelling area The A3R system does not require any additional equipment on the receiving aircraft and is designed to reduce the workload of the Air Refuelling Operator ARO improve safety and the speed of air to air refuelling under operational conditions thus helping to maximise air superiority The objective for the A3R system which Airbus claims can now be implemented on the A330 MRTT is to develop technologies that achieve fully autonomous capabilities Once the system is activated by the ARO the A3R automatically flies the boom and maintains the alignment between the boom tip and the receiver mount with an accuracy of a few centimeters The correct alignment and stability of the receiver are checked in real time allowing safe distance between the boom and receiver to be maintained It also determines the optimum time to extend the telescopic boom in order to achieve the connection with the receiver At this point fuel transfer is initiated to replenish the receiver aircraft then after completion and instruction of decoupling the boom is moved away from the receiver by retracting the telescopic beam and flying the boom away to maintain a safe separation distance Throughout this process the ARO simply monitors the operation for which the

Rosoboronexport CEO He added that several African Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian countries as well as Russia\u2019s neighbouring states have already expressed interest in the BOOMERANG and Mr

range of combat and peacekeeping missions for which it carries a crew of and to troops It employs an advanced module design with the driving compartment to the front left the engine compartment to the front right the fighting compartment in the middle and the troop compartment at the rear with entry and exit possible via roof hatches the rear door or a ramp Depending on what the customer requests a variety of manned or remote controlled weapon stations can be mounted on the platform such as a mm automatic cannon with a mm coaxial machine gun To control the weapons and conduct aimed fire its modern digital fire control system includes a two plane weapon stabiliser a multi channel electro optical sighting system with a built in laser rangefinder in addition to automated gunner and commander workstations with a multi function display and an integrated ballistic computer High mobility and a smooth ride are achieved through the use of eight wheel drive independent suspension and a

negotiate water obstacles even in Sea State with a speed of at least km h with a keeping endurance of up to hours Competition According to Russian sources the BOOMERANG can meet and even exceed foreign combat vehicles in terms of cross country mobility through a more powerful engine in protection thanks to an active armour system and in fire power due to the use of combined armament with

"text": "The Blohm Voss BV was a World War II German tactical reconnaissance aircraft notable for its uncommon structural asymmetry Although the Blohm Voss BV performed well it was never ordered into full scale production for reasons that included the unavailability of the preferred engine and competition from another tactical reconnaissance aircraft the Focke Wulf Fw Development edit In the German Air Ministry \u2013 the Reichsluftfahrtministerium RLM \u2013 issued a specification for a single engine reconnaissance aircraft with optimal visual characteristics The preferred contractor was Arado with the Ar but the prototype proved unsuccessful The eventual winner was the Focke Wulf Fw Uhu even though its twin boom design using two smaller engines did not match the requirement of a single engined aircraft Blohm Voss Hamburger Flugzeugbau although not invited to participate pursued as a private venture something far more radical The proposal of chief designer Dr Richard Vogt was the uniquely asymmetric BV The Plexiglas glazed crew gondola on the starboard side strongly resembled that found on the Fw and housed the pilot observer and rear gunner while the fuselage on the port side led smoothly from the BMW N a radial engine to a tail unit At first glance the placement of weight would have induced tendency to roll but the weight was evenly supported by lift from the wings In terms of thrust vs drag asymmetry the countering of induced yaw was a more complicated matter At low airspeed it was calculated to be mostly alleviated because of a phenomenon known as P factor while at normal airspeed it proved to be easily controlled with trimming The tailplane was symmetrical at first but in the 141B it became asymmetrical \u2013 starboard tailplane virtually removed \u2013 to improve the rear gunner s fields of view and fire Operational history edit Three prototypes and an evaluation batch of five BV 141As were produced backed personally by Ernst Udet but the RLM decided on April that they were underpowered although it was also noted they otherwise exceeded the requirements By the time a batch of BV 141Bs were built with the more powerful BMW engines they were too late to make an impression as the RLM had already decided to put the Fw into production Indeed an urgent need for BMW engines for use in the Fw fighter aircraft reduced the chance of the BV 141B being produced in quantity Vogt came up with several other asymmetric designs including the piston jet P but none of those were actually built Several wrecked BV 141s were found by advancing Allied forces One was captured by British forces and sent to England for examination No examples survive today Variants edit Contrary to much that has been written citation needed b all BV 141Bs ordered were

safety concerns at the factory In past weeks following several positive COVID cases at the plant the union has called for a two week shutdown of the factory increased sick pay and has lobbied for the company to begin producing ventilators in Lynn Union leadership said in a past interview the company has denied those requests and in its latest notice which was posted on its Facebook page the union said GE was following the lead of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by placing profits before people GE spokesman Richard Gorham maintains the company has acted early and aggressively during the COVID pandemic to ensure employee health and safety at GE Lynn going over and above CDC guidelines and drawing on best practices from our global experience He said those actions have included daily meetings with the company s cleaning contractor and site leadership on cleaning protocols which have been ongoing for the past two months Those protocols are evaluated daily Gorham said based on guidance from national and local health authorities Throughout this unprecedented time employee safety has been our top priority said Gorham in a statement We stand behind the measures we have taken to address this health challenge by protecting our employees while continuing to meet our obligations to the U S military We continue to meet with the union and invite them to join us on

Guardian can see your contributions and one of our journalists may contact you to discuss further Tell us \u201cCriminals have realised that there is big demand from people stuck at home looking at buying motorhomes to be used when we are allowed out again \u201d said the investigator who works under the name Jack Buster \u201cI\u2019d implore anyone who has been talking to a supposed seller in recent days to stop and under no circumstances send them any money \u201d Fraudsters use fake listings copied from legitimate adverts to attract buyers then tell them that they will deliver the vehicle if they put the money into a holding account Although they say the cash will not be released until the buyer has seen the vehicle and agreed to finalise the purchase the money is taken straight away and the customer is left with nothing The coronavirus pandemic has given fraudsters a new reason to ask for money ahead of delivery as buyers are not able to get out to inspect vehicles It has also made camper vans attractive to families who are looking for ways to safely take a summer break The Guardian was contacted this week by Simon Barker who said he had lost \u00a3 to \u201ca highly sophisticated fraud\u201d He had spotted a motorhome on eBay and had emailed someone called Nathan Edgar Wright who claimed to be selling the vehicle on behalf of his father in Ireland Barker was told that owing to the lockdown the motorhome would be delivered by a transport company The seller reassured him that if he paid using Paypal\u2019s pay after delivery service he he would have five days to look over the vehicle before the money was released \u201cHe then tried and failed to send me a Paypal invoice at which point I was seemingly contacted by a representative from Paypal via a live chat window It certainly looked very convincing \u201d Barker said \u201cHe gave me a reference and a bank account number to transfer funds to The seller had even sent me what he said was a scan of his passport photo page as ID Of course the delivery never happened and I now realise I have been scammed \u201cFurther investigation since has revealed that the listing I replied to has appeared on eBay before \u201d Buster said that while this fraud was by no means new thousands of fraudulent listings appeared on eBay last week alone One fraudulent motorhome listing has been viewed times he said \u201cSadly there has also been a big jump in reports from victims saying they have lost money to the scammers They are coming into our offices every few hours at the moment \u201d he said \u201cNormally they find a hundred reasons why you can\u2019t come and see the vehicle but they don\u2019t have to right now for obvious reasons \u201d He added \u201cThese are organised criminals doing this on an industrial scale and they are very good at it People buying high end sports cars saloons motorhomes and even JCBs have all fallen for these scams that target eBay Gumtree and AutoTrader The vehicles are always advertised at attractive prices to lure people into thinking they are getting a bargain \u201d Part of the problem may be that legitimate vehicle sites now offer a service where people agree to buy cars online and only pay for them on receipt An eBay spokeswoman said the company invested heavily in dedicated fraud prevention teams \u201cIt is always advisable to make payment once the buyer has viewed the item in person We recommend treating with caution any request for bank transfers in advance of viewing the vehicle \u201cAll users are encouraged to use their best judgment follow the vehicle buying tips outlined in our safety centre and research the item carefully before making any payments If a buyer is unsure if the vehicle being offered is legitimate we\u2019d recommend contacting eBay customer service \u201d Vehicle scams are just one of a number that have been ramped up by criminals since the start of the lockdown The UK\u2019s

Scala", "text": "The Death of Hype What s Next for Scala A recent tweet by a friend of mine noted how the public interest in the Scala programming language seems to have plateaued or waned which matches my feeling of the latest trends and zeitgeist This blog post will go into why I think that has happened where Scala stands now and what the future holds for the Scala community About the Author Haoyi is a software engineer and the author of many open source Scala tools such as the Ammonite REPL and the Mill Build Tool If you enjoyed the contents on this blog you may also enjoy Haoyi s book Hands on Scala Programming This blogpost was inspired by the following tweet It s a shame to see friends from Typesafe Lightbend being laid off but as I ve always said it s hard to sell free stuff I do wonder about Scala s adoption now It s not Clojure dead but it seemed to peak around I have zero data to back that though Jamie notes that public interest in the Scala programming language seems to have waned less interest in meetups less interest in conferences and so on This more or less matches what I am seeing as well While the Scala specific conferences targeting enthusiasts are still going strong or were until COVID19 shut down the global economy I think there is no doubt that there is much less talk about Scala in the broader engineering community I think that this reduction in public interest is real but also expected given the typical Hype Cycle that follows any new technology Early on Scala rode a wave of hype that frankly surprised even me hype around pushing syntactic boundaries hype around reactive architectures hype around functional programming hype around the Apache Spark project Much of that hype has since died down and there was a period of backlash and negativity both within the Scala community and outside of it Since then even the backlash has faded and what is left is a reasonable boring language steadily advancing and providing a great platform for general software engineering The Past the Peak of Inflated Expectations While Scala was initially created in the language only really started taking off in the early 2010s Twitter started picking up the language for production systems the first tagged release of the Scalaz functional programming library Lightbend a company pushing Scala and related technologies was founded Apache Spark was written in Scala first tagged release of the Cats functional programming library While there was no doubt activity in the Scala community before this these were no doubt major milestones that kickstarted interest in the language With large scale commercial adoption commercial support and a killer big data product like Apache Spark it is not surprising that there was a surge in public interest A lot of these efforts went into the following domains Pushing Syntactic Boundaries A lot of early Scala interest was in how flexible the language was it had extension methods operator overloading implicit constructors conversions and a very flexible implicit parameter feature that could be used in all sorts of ways This flexibility was liberating as it opened up all sorts of domain specific languages and programming styles that would be unheard of in other languages These were exemplified by a number of projects such as the Databinder Dispatch HTTP client Scala Graph data structure library or SBT build tool Making a HTTP request and processing the output in Databinder Dispatch executer host port target fromRespStr Constructing a simple directed graph with labelled edges in Scala Graph val flights Graph jfc fra Flight LH o h fra dme Flight LH o h Append the contents of a URL to a File after filtering through grep using SBT url grep JSON file About JSON Search for uses of null in the source directory using SBT find src name scala exec grep null xargs test z echo null free echo null detected Many of these libraries have evolved since the early days and have since moved to more boring method based APIs It turns out that naming operators or while possible was not always the wisest thing to do Nevertheless there is no doubt that pushing the boundaries of Scala s syntax using operators and domain specific languages was one of the big points of interest for early Scala Reactive Architectures Reactive architectures pushed largely by Lightbend via their Akka Actor framework was another big effort This was a way of writing code that was very different from normal code that someone might learn in school but allowed high levels of concurrency and performance beyond what is achievable writing code in a traditional style In its initial incantation Akka Actors sacrificed a lot of what Scala what it is a total lack of type safety between actors prohibiting blocking APIs and many other idiosyncracies Working with Akka Actors were basically their own language embedded in Scala but with their own conventions syntax and semantics More recently with Typed Actors and Reactive Streams the Akka developer experience has shifted to be much closer to the type checked experience you would expect in typical Scala programs I think there s also been a shift in the community mood rather than treating reactive architectures like a general purpose solution to all problems they are now being treated as one possible approach for one specific class of problems That mostly matches my own experience using these techniques in my own applications Functional Programming Functional programming in Scala is best exemplified by the Scalaz and Cats projects These two libraries attempt to bring much of the functional programming techniques from Haskell to the Scala language a heavy focus on concepts like Monads or Applicatives eschewing the object oriented side of the language for a more pure functional style The two libraries have different styles and both remain heavily used by portions of the community today The evangelism has died down to some extent but usage remains strong and everyone recognizes functional programming as one possible style in which to write your Scala applications Apache Spark The last big project that drove Scala s early hype was Apache Spark A distributed big data process framework Apache Spark leveraged Scala s functional style and serializable lambdas to take common collection like map filter and reduce and run them distributed over a compute cluster processing huge amounts of data Apache Spark allowed big data processing pipelines to be written in orders of magnitude less code and running in orders of magnitude less time than the earlier Hadoop APIs Spark proved an instant hit Apache Spark was Scala s killer app A huge fraction of the Scala community is only using Scala because they need to inter operate with Spark in some way Apache Spark now supports developer APIs in many languages SQL R with Python being the most popular The original collections like APIs have been largely superseded by a more SQL like interface that allows better optimizability an important factor when working with the huge datasets that Apache Spark is often used for Nevertheless the Apache Spark codebase remains mostly Scala to this day In the Trough of Disillusionment Since the initial spark there definitely has been some backlash against Scala as the initial hype has died down Some early contributors have left the community and there was some inter personal unhappiness This was not just in aggregate but on an individual level as well I personally know many individuals who got tired of the things they themselves had been hyping and moved on with a slightly sour taste in their mouths It s hard to pin point an exact time where the hype died down perhaps around Even on a technical level not all was well While many organizations used these techniques successfully in their respective niches others have regretted going all in on actors and all in on functional programming They were finding that these techniques don t fit their problem as well as they would have liked and had to spend some time backing out of their all in investment in a particular programming paradigm I personally know many organizations who have had to make this adjustment Even before the fall in the early 2010s I was surprised at the amount of hype around some of these technologies The usage of operators in some of these libraries was clearly through the roof and sometimes turned even simple tasks into complex brain teasers The amount of hype I saw around reactive architectures and functional programming did not match the specialized use cases I found that they fit best every Scala conference had keynote speakers evangelizing both of these approaches as the be all end all future of software architecture It surprises me not at all that over time others would join me in realizing the Trough of Disillusionment The Present on the Slope of Enlightenment Scala had its hype in the early 2010s followed by a backlash against that hype in the mid late 2010s Where does that leave Scala now Despite the apparent downturn in public interest usage of Scala continues to increase I maintain a large number of open source libraries and the number of unique IPs downloading these libraries from the Maven Central package repository has grown just over 2x over the last year While there is some variation in the number of downloads or the metrics for each individual package overall they match this trend quite closely While this growth isn t the exponential rocket ship that some projects are hoping for this is a steady increase in usage that matches my own subjective experience usage of Scala continues to increase even as the hype has died away If we can maintain this 2x growth every year I think the Scala community will continue to be in pretty good shape If you look at the most recent Redmonk Rankings or Tiobe Rankings they both show Scala as stably hovering just outside the clique of mainstream languages ranked and respectively Uncommon but not obscure With the hype and the backlash both distant memories we now see Scala for what it is a flexible language supporting multiple programming styles each with their own tradeoffs and use cases A lot of the early religiosity and conflict has transformed into people using Scala for steady work enjoying the language in the way they each choose A Solid Platform for Production Usage Despite the reduction in hype the Scala language is in a lot better place than it used to be The SBT build tool has improved by leaps and bounds in the last few years massively faster and easier to use If you don t like SBT you now have a choice many organizations use Bazel or Pants with Scala while my own Mill build tool is stable and widely used New tools like Coursier are forming a new foundation for the ecosystem used by tools from Ammonite to SBT to Mill The Metals project brings Scala support to VSCode Sublime Text and any other editor with language server support Intellij s own Scala plugin continues to improve faster more accurate and with support for new tools like Ammonite scripts or the Mill build tool The new collections library in Scala cleans up a huge number of old warts and significantly improves performance in many cases e g speedup on Sjsonnet Polish features like pattern matching on strings or warning suppression continue to make life better for everyone The compiler itself is massively sped up with code compiling literally twice as fast as it did just three years ago While the language specification has hardly changed at all in the past few years the amount of quality of life improvements that have landed is hard to overstate If you had talked to any Scala using engineering organization about halving their compile times back in they would have showered you with money to make it happen Each of the these individually has significantly improved my own personal experience writing Scala and there are many more improvements that I cannot comprehensively list here A Broad and Varied Ecosystem While the hype around the original four efforts has waned these still form large and active sub communities within the Scala ecosystem For example while not everyone may want to use pure functional programming and any individual may not want to use it all the time the libraries and ecosystem surrounding it are nevertheless varied high quality and well maintained When you do encounter an occasion to use pure functional programming you will find everything you need In a way the hype has served its purpose by introducing a large number of people to a particular paradigm it helps achieve the critical mass for some fraction of those people to sustain that sub community going forward The broad range of styles in Scala can be thought of as a boon rather than considering it a way of splitting the community apart it is a way of bringing together communities that would otherwise never interact with each other Without Scala these communities may be disparately working in Haskell Python Java and Go systems By focusing on what s shared rather than what s different Scala allows these communities to collaborate on the things that benefit them all while still preserving the things that make each sub community unique I personally do not default to architecting my code reactively using Actors but I have shipped production code that heavily uses Actors when the situation called for them I do not default to pure functional programming techniques but I have used pretty esoteric constructs like Free Applicatives when useful I think the community as a whole has matured in a similar way appreciating the different styles and using them where appropriate without the dogmatism that plagued the early days of Scala The Future So what exciting things do I think lie in Scala s Future To me the Scala language itself is in a relatively good state An afternoon writing modern Java code is enough to relieve me of any illusions that other languages have caught up as does spending days trying unsuccessfully to package a Python project into a standalone executable Hello there Azure CLI Where the greatest potential lies is in introducing Scala to new sets of people or new sets of use cases that up to this point have been completely out of bounds I think there are two main things that stand out to me Usability In the initial four Scala efforts one thing was missing from all of them the ability for a new developer to start on a codebase and be immediately productive It doesn t matter whether you were using an operator heavy dispatch style a actor heavy reactive style or a pure FP Cats Scalaz style someone trying to onboard was going to have a hard time Why does that need to be the case As a counter example developers generally find Python an easy language to get started with executable pseudocode they call it New programmers learn Python Non programmers learn Python When people write code on a whiteboard with a marker they often write Python While Python s performance concurrency or large scale maintenability are questionable its ease of getting started is unmatched Why can t Scala be as easy to get started with as Python Answering that question is the goal of the entire suite of libraries that I maintain Many of my libraries are carbon copies shameless clones of their Python equivalents For example Ammonite a clone of the IPython REPL uPickle a clone of the Python json module PPrint a clone of the Python pprint module Requests Scala a clone of Kenneth Rietz Requests module OS Lib a clone of the Python os sys and shutil modules Cask a clone of the Armin Ronacher s Flask library It turns out that you can make Scala as easy to get started with as Python And for all of Pythons weaknesses performance concurrency maintainability Scala already does excellently Scala has the potential to be the language with the usability and flexiblity of Python with the performance and scalability of Java or Go and type safe maintainability far beyond any of those options Quite literally the best of both worlds While there will always be use cases where high concurrency reactive architectures or pure functional programming are the best tool for the job I hope going forward that developers will be able to onboard onto the Scala language in an easy and straightforward way and only need to learn those more advanced techniques when the need for it comes Scala Native Scala js has demonstrated the feasiblity of using Scala on an alternate platform compiled to Javascript instead of on the JVM it has a vibrant ecosystem and community and brings the Scala language into the browser somewhere it could never be used before Scala Native promises an even bigger revolution by compiling Scala to self contained binary executables that would allow the Scala language to be used in scenarios where the startup time and resource overhead of a JVM or Javascript runtime is unacceptable While Scala js brought Scala to the browser Scala Native promises to bring Scala to a host of new environments Command line tools like git ls rsync etc which cannot tolerate the startup time of the JVM Sidecar processes or background daemons where the significant memory overhead of the JVM makes using Scala problematic Mobile development on iOS running on iPhones and iPads one of the most ubiquitous consumer computing devices in the world Desktop applications where the JVM startup time is too slow or bundling the JVM too bulky Deep integrations with native libraries like the Tensorflow machine learning framework These sorts of programs have been traditionally written in unsafe languages like C or C More recent implementations are often written in Rust or Go and there s a whole cottage industry of not C programming languages like Nim Zig or Crystal also trying to fill this space Scala Native promises to be able to fill this space not with a brand new language but with an already popular language with an existing rich ecosystem of libraries and tooling Scala Native will be much more difficult to make successful than Scala js was In particular Scala js could focus on the compiler and then delegate to an existing Javascript runtime while Scala Native has to build its own runtime from first principles threading garbage collection event loops and so on This is addition to the formidable amount of compiler work necessary Nevertheless if successful this would be a massive boon for broadening the use cases for which the Scala language can be used Conclusion While amount of hype around the Scala language has definitely died down over the years the usage seems to be growing at a steady clip and the experience of using the language has been improving rapidly This is exactly what you would expect as a language progresses through the hype cycle and moves from a fad driven community to a value driven community Scala developers are using the language not as an end unto itself but instead as a solid tool they can use to accomplish their non Scala related technical or business objectives In effect this is what it means for the community to mature Going forward I hope we can see more of this More focus on outcomes and value rather than hype More weighing of tradeoffs rather than dogmatism More celebrating the shared core rather than arguing over the differences And more 2x compiler speedups I think the way we 10x the Scala community is not by spending 10x the effort bikeshedding over the existing language syntax 10x the effort arguing about functional vs object oriented programming or 10x the effort trying to make our already very type safe code even more type safe It is instead by inclusively expanding the language to reach those developers we could never reach before the newbies the non programmers the command line tool folks the iOS developers and so on If we look at the Jetbrains Developer Survey for Python we can see the breadth of different domains in which the Python language is used Currently Scala is overwhelmingly used for backend services and or Spark data pipelines but there is no reason the above use cases couldn t be satisfied by Scala as well It s up to the community to make using Scala easy and broadly usable enough that anyone not just the grizzled backend data engineers are able to pick up Scala and and use it while enjoying the conciseness performance and type safety that those within the Scala community already know and love About the Author Haoyi is a software engineer and the author of

devastate Fiji\u2019s tourism industry Photograph Sheldon Chanel The Guardian Fiji has so far recorded confirmed Covid cases with no deaths so far The government responded swiftly and firmly to the outbreak closing the country\u2019s main airport in Nadi on March six days after Fiji announced its first confirmed case which was brought into the country by a flight attendant Since then the entire country has to abide by a curfew from 8pm to 5am and police and the military are out enforcing the coronavirus laws The country is braced for a deadly outbreak that would quickly stretch its health system to breaking point But even if the worst case health scenario is avoided a devastating economic impact looks unavoidable Tourism contributes nearly to Fiji\u2019s gross domestic product \u2013 about FJ 2bn AU 4bn \u2013 and directly or indirectly employs over people in various industries Last year Fiji had more tourists coming into the country than residents living in it roughly The bulk of

Tony Whitton managing director of Rosie Holidays and Ahura Resorts The Rosie Group plans to reduce its workforce from about workers to essential staff in the coming weeks \u201cMy view is that it will take one year at least \u2013 so until the end of \u2013 just for the industry to recover and we won\u2019t see growth until at least \u201d he said adding that any recovery in the industry will depend on when source markets such as Australia and New Zealand open their borders again The knock on effect of these job cuts will be enormous Many of those employed in the tourism sector support

Fiji\u2019s economy afloat \u201cOur top heavy tax system has taken all domestic liquidity away and left operators with minimal profit and significantly reduced cashflows for most small businesses

Bank\u2019s recently released East Asia and the Pacific economic update the severity of the contraction will depend on how long the Covid crisis lasts Professor Stephen Pratt head of the tourism school at the University of the South Pacific says that the crisis was an opportunity for operators to reimagine what Fiji\u2019s industry will resemble in a post coronavirus world \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a paradigm shift and it\u2019s a chance for the industry and academics to say what sort of tourism do we want going forward \u201d he said \u201cI think there will be some fundamental changes in not just Fiji but the source markets as well International politics are involved so there might be things like safe countries or blocs of countries that have their own agreements for travellers

Pakistan making major purchases of top of the line Chinese export equipment Here are some of the most powerful weapons China has sold or licensed to Pakistan Nuclear Weapons Program The acquisition of

in Europe and Air Forces Africa Airmen around the theater have played a variety of roles in supporting the Department of Defense COVID response Several Airmen however have had the unique opportunity to directly assist the Italian air force the French air force and the United Kingdom\u2019s Royal Air Force in their response efforts These Airmen are part of the U S Air Force Military Personnel Exchange Program which is a special duty assignment that allows the Air Force to foster and expand international relationships with coalition and global partners Maj Jeffrey Furnary is a C 130J Super Hercules pilot assigned to the Italian air force\u2019s Secondo Gruppo Volo Brigata Aerea 2nd Flight Group 46th Air Brigade in Pisa Italy While this group\u2019s primary mission is strategic and tactical transport its missions can also include aeromedical evacuation a specialty that has been in high demand during Italy\u2019s response to COVID \u201cDuring the first week of Italy\u2019s national lockdown we started flying COVID patients and supplies to try to get patients to ICU intensive care unit beds in other parts of the country \u201d Furnary said \u201cFrom a pilot s perspective it is just another day but when you think about the impact you can make for the patient it is highly rewarding \u201d Capt Daniel Mahon a combat search and rescue pilot assigned to the French air force\u2019s Helicopter Squadron Pyrenees Base A\u00e9rienne Cazaux Air Base France had maintained a hour alert with his unit since March waiting to be employed to support civilian authorities On the night of March Mahon was on alert status when his unit was tasked to provide medical evacuation support and he was one of the first individuals tasked from his unit \u201cWe left for Villacoublay the morning of April and subsequently performed two simultaneous missions transporting four patients from Paris Orly to Caen and Angers respectively \u201d Mahon said \u201cThe hospitals in Paris were becoming oversaturated to the point where there simply were not enough resources human or material to provide the appropriate level of care Our actions prevented medical staff from having to triage or reject patients altogether \u201d The captain said it was both humbling and rewarding to be able to participate in an operation of such grand scale and importance in direct support of French citizens Maj Rich Schanda is also a CSAR pilot and currently is a Puma Exchange Pilot assigned to the RAF\u2019s Squadron A flight RAF Benson United Kingdom where his primary mission is to provide general helicopter support to the Ministry of Defense Since the COVID pandemic began Schanda said his squadron\u2019s primary mission has shifted to providing logistical and MEDEVAC support to the Scottish population \u201cWe provide MEDEVAC coverage from Kinloss Barracks \u201d Schanda said \u201cWhen there are COVID patients that need to be moved from isolated or remote areas of Scotland particularly the outlying islands and the highlands and fixed wing aircraft cannot get to them we are tasked to evacuate them and bring them to one of the larger hospitals in Glasgow or Edinburgh \u201d Schanda said the most rewarding aspect of these missions has been reassuring the Scottish people that the military has their back and will come to their aid no matter the time or place All three of the exchange pilots lauded the extensive mission planning for health and safety concerns of the aircrew by both military and their civilian counterparts to ensure their continuation of their military missions \u201cIt s an absolute honor working alongside the RAF They are extremely professional and take great care in their work \u201d said Schanda \u201cI get a lot of satisfaction being able to bring my CSAR experience and apply it to the current situation helping the Puma squadron when and where I can \u201d Furnary echoed Schanda\u2019s sentiments \u201cI am just a member of the amazing group here in Pisa \u201d Furnary said \u201c I am extremely proud to fly with them on missions that mean so much to their country and its people \u201d As the world continues

Then lockdown came The move was off the boys\u2019 school closed and the 3D printer seemed a good way of filling long days at home Instead of Pok\u00e9mon and Minecraft figures the boys \u2013 with help from their parents \u2013 embarked on a very different project printing PPE visors for people working in local care homes in Wrexham north Wales A month after their first attempt the project has grown into a volunteer hub manned by people around the clock based in a local school and using dozens of donated and crowdfunded printers to supply visors a day A new injection moulding process will shortly come on stream enabling the group to increase production to up to a day \u201cI am so proud of them and how this has grown \u201d said Rebecca Sparey Taylor a curate who had been due to take up a new post today as vicar for four churches in Denbigh before lockdown scuppered the move Graham her husband lectures in automotive engineering at the University of Wolverhampton The boys designed their first visor on the basis of a photograph posted online by an engineering friend of the family Within a few days a Facebook appeal had resulted in donations of acetate sheeting to use for screens

also have some with no experience including relatives of NHS workers I\u2019ve been impressed by the number of teenagers and students who\u2019ve volunteered Young people get such a bad press but they\u2019re so keen to help \u2013 they\u2019re an absolute inspiration \u201d Wrexham councillor Phil Wynn who has been heavily involved with the project said \u201cWe\u2019d hoped to make a few hundred masks but we\u2019ve gone from this to a project where we make visors a week \u2013 and that number is growing We have people at home working on their own machines and in schools across the town \u201d The boys are still producing visors at home and visiting the hub regularly said Sparey Taylor They have been astonished at how quickly the project developed \u201cI heard Joseph describing it as like having a caterpillar in your hand which grows into a beautiful butterfly and flies away \u201d Isaac said he felt \u201ckind of overwhelmed\u201d by the speed of events \u201cThere\u2019s

Relief to Those Fighting COVID-19", "text": "New York National Guard soldiers airmen and active duty and civilian medical providers fighting COVID in New York City are getting the benefit of licks and a wagging tail to lift their spirits The troops are returning the favor with belly rubs The dogs are courtesy of Puppies Behind Bars a New York City nonprofit organization that pairs inmates in regional prisons with puppies to be trained to become service dogs The group brought the dogs to hotels where guardsmen and medical providers were staying as well as the alternate care facility at the Jacob Javits Convention Center in Manhattan to give those responding to COVID a stress break according to Gloria Gilbert Stoga the program coordinator There s something about a dog that people love and they gravitate to and let their guard down Army Sgt 1st Class Richard Masci New York Army National Guardsman Army Sgt 1st Class Richard Masci a New York Army National Guardsman assigned to the 104th Military Police battalion first suggested the idea April when he was talking to the unit s rear detachment The National Guard was asked by Sergeant Masci in Kingston if they needed anything and their answer was Service dogs half in jest Stoga said There s something about a dog that people love and they gravitate to and let their guard down Masci said The idea was raised up to the governor s office Stoga said and they recommended Puppies so here we are As soon as we were asked I said that of course we would help and one week later Friday April we started Stoga continued Puppies Behind Bars began in and has almost two dozen years of breeding and training experience to prepare dogs for service or therapy duties It was a perfect fit for the current military missions in New York Stoga said The amount of stress that the military and medical personnel serving in New York City are going through is extraordinary Stoga said The fact that our dogs can provide some comfort makes me prouder than I think I have ever been of them The dogs are raised and trained in seven different correctional facilities in upstate New York About prison inmates raise the service dogs and with support of the Puppies Behind Bars staff train them for wounded veterans and first responders To prepare them for the work the dogs receive some hours of socialization during their two years of training We re set to do eight shifts a week two hours each and the idea is that this is a way for the young soldiers of the Guard to decompress to just pet a dog and have a dog lick them and kiss them The dogs live in prison with puppy raisers inmates who are matched with them for the mutual benefit and bonding the training brings Our dogs learn instinctively to help people who need them Stoga said Stoga discovered that the efforts have reached further than the uniformed responders in New York The Guard is also taking the dogs to meet with the nurses when they come back from the hospitals around the city and what I ve found out that I didn t know is that the nurses are literally coming from around the country Stoga said They don t know anybody they re working or hour shifts and they re coming back to their hotels and the National Guard is there with service dogs and the nurses get to pet them and love them The dogs are doing amazing work out in the world and at this particular moment in time are bringing a tiny bit of joy and normalcy to people for whom joy and normalcy seem almost impossible to remember Gloria Gilbert Stoga program coordinator Puppies Behind Bars The ability to hug and pet a dog during a time of social distancing is what makes the difference said Army Capt Yvette Valle the headquarters detachment commander for the 104th Military Police Battalion The experience here is quite surreal and unlike anything I ve experienced in the military she said With the long hours and the stress of the unknown the missions for soldiers during the pandemic has been unlike any other disaster response effort Valle said The biggest thing I promote within my company is a positive mental attitude during this crisis and their attitude has been more than I expected with everyone willing to do whatever is needed Valle said Bringing in the dogs has certainly made a difference Coordinating the dogs has definitely boosted morale with the soldiers and with the nurses Valle said It gives them a piece of family a closeness that we can t experience due to social distancing Valle added They can get that through the dogs It gives them love and warmth that they are sacrificing being here for this cause The dogs are doing amazing work out in the world and at this particular moment in time are bringing a tiny bit of joy and normalcy to people for whom joy and normalcy seem almost impossible to remember Stoga said The dogs trained to work with veterans wounded warriors and first responders are a natural fit for supporting the National Guard response effort and can make a real difference for soldiers said Army Maj Gen Ray Shields the Adjutant General of New York s military forces I am sure this means the world to all those who get to spend time with the puppies Shields continued I went twice last week with two dogs Stoga said One was raised in Fishkill and one in Bedford Hills Serving as a stress relief the visits are now a regular part of the working shifts for military and medical responders at the Javits Medical Station and hotels in Manhattan Stoga spoke with one off duty soldier during a visit on April and asked where he was from A small town in Dutchess County he replied Fishkill Pointing to one of the dogs Stoga said This dog was raised in the Fishkill Correctional Facility The soldier couldn t believe it he got down on his knees to meet a new hometown friend she added It s been a great success Masci said Everybody is thrilled to see them For Puppies Behind Bars all of our service dogs go to wounded war vets or first responders Stoga said So these dogs being able to help in this way before they are placed is just phenomenal We re just thrilled to be able to work with the National Guard like this Army Col Richard

"Sometimes called the world s smallest army or the Pope s army it is officially the Guardia Svizzera or Swiss Guards the soldiers responsible for the safety of the pope The Pontifical Swiss Guard is made up of to soldiers The unit not only serves as the escorts to the pontiff but also as the watchmen for Vatican City and the pontifical villa of Castel Gandolfo This small unit is made up of former Swiss soldiers and recruits must be unmarried Swiss Catholic males between the ages of and who have completed their basic training with the Swiss Armed Forces While largely ceremonial since the failed assassination attempt made on Pope John Paul II in there has been a much stronger emphasis on the actual protection duties and this has included unarmed combat as well as with small arms Today the Swiss Guards are among the oldest standing military units in the world First founded on January by Pope Julius II it became known as a mercenary force when Switzerland was known for having some of the best fighting men in Europe Despite the fact that all are Swiss the unit remains completely independent of the actual Swiss military Each guard agrees to a mandatory year contract and that can be extended upon request The guard s colorful uniforms which may seem straight out of the Renaissance or perhaps even a Renaissance Fair are striped in the colors \u2013 red dark blue and yellow \u2013 of the once powerful Italian Medici family of Florence Contrary to popular belief the uniforms weren t designed by Italian artists Michelangelo or Raphael The actual designer is lost to time but the uniforms were last updated in by Jules Repond a former commander of the unit Each uniform is made up of pieces and is tailor made inside the Vatican especially for each member of the guard As with other ceremonial units around the world the look is somewhat anachronistic in the 21st century with its white ruffles high plume Morion helmet with ostrich feathers to denote rank and breastplates In this traditional dress the guards are equipped with pikes and swords a tradition that hasn t changed with the passing years The men of the Swiss Guard look ready to fight a war from centuries ago which is somewhat fitting as the unit hasn t actually taken part in any modern war However this doesn t mean that the Guards haven t had to fight The Swiss Guard s first major engagement actually proved both the force s dedication and its abilities That action occurred on May when the army of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V sacked Rome and attempted to invade Saint Peter s Basilica in Vatican City The small Swiss Guard held back the attackers long enough for Pope Clement VII to escape through a half mile long passageway to Castel Sant Angelo the large fortress nearby Nearly of the guards serving the pope gave their lives to see him to safety To honor that first battle each May new recruits are sworn into the guard by the pope himself Peter Suciu is a Michigan based writer who has

temperature drops below 70F as it did briefly this week there is always the tennis courts or vast landscaped gardens There is no need to carry an authorisation letter to go jogging when the acre gated and guarded domain is chez vous Now local officials are investigating reports that super wealthy residents of the complex overlooking the Bay de Canoubiers on the French Riviera also had access to private coronavirus tests at a time when even local hospital staff face a lack of screening The local newspaper Var Matin reported around of Les Parcs\u2019 residents and their friends had been offered Covid tests at a private unit on the grounds staffed by a doctor and technician This was carried out as part of a \u201ctotally private screening operation\u201d allegedly organised by the president of Les Parcs Association Jean Louis Oger a wealthy French pharmacist who has several clinics and laboratories in the south of France Less fortunate neighbours reacted with anger

your contributions and one of our journalists may contact you to discuss further Tell us In a statement published on the town hall website he said the blood tests had been carried out on people \u201cin a private domain and unpaid\u201d as a sample to be analysed by certain unnamed \u201claboratories\u201d And he insisted the operation was carried out \u201cunder the aegis of the Pasteur Institute\u201d to whom the results would be sent The test could not be used by local hospital staff because it had not been approved by the health authorities he added However the Pasteur Institute in Paris a national centre for developing and authorising tests said it knew nothing about those carried out at Les Parcs \u201cThis is a trial carried out by a private laboratory The laboratory is doing its own thing in its own corner We\u2019re not advocating wildcat studies they need to be evaluated with the results of baseline tests \u201d it told French journalists \u201cWe work with blood plasma from patients plasma that has already been verified collected within the legal framework of clinical trials \u201d the Institute added It described Mayor Tuveri\u2019s statement as \u201cquite suspicious\u201d \u201cHe quotes us and links us to this when we were not at all aware of it \u201d the institute added The regional health authority ARS Paca also said they had not heard of or

assistant secretary of the Navy for research development and acquisition authorized all of its commands to support FEMA requests saying that the country is in a national emergency so they must engage

Commander my job is to develop leaders and assess train and educate the Army within the training base This COVID virus is a new condition in our training environment Commanders and leaders are trained to assess risks then mitigate those risks We are taking prudent measures to recognize need and develop procedures and limit risk America has some of the greatest medical minds in the world working on this virus response so as new techniques and procedures emerge we must train educate adapt and implement those new procedures Army leaders in Korea and Italy have already seen success in the fight against this virus The Army thrives as a learning organization sharing lessons learned from across the force Early on the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Secretary of the Army directed us to reach out to General Abrams\u2019 team in Korea and Major General Roger Cloutier\u2019s team in Italy And we\u2019ve taken their lessons learned from establishing a bubble around their forces and adjusted them to our particular circumstances We\u2019ve applied the security bubble approach throughout the training base and conducted multiple movement rehearsals for several of our training centers to follow on training locations In order to expand on these measures and in concert with guidance from the Department of the Army along with expert assessments from the COVID threat decisions have been made to pause the shipment of trainees to Basic Combat Training This conditions based pause allows leaders to further focus on setting conditions to restart movement in a safer manner I want to be clear that this is not a pause in training for the Soldiers currently at our training centers Our Drill Sergeants the best in the world will continue to socially distance enabled training and conduct regular screening to identify Soldiers that need to be treated We are still training every day to fight and win our nation\u2019s wars as our Nation expects us to do During the pause our Commanders will ensure we have the right most current procedures and capabilities in place to screen and test our recruits Those measures start with Major General Muth\u2019s team identifying recruits for shipment focusing on reduced risk areas The pause ensures appropriate procedures processes materials and personnel are in place to thicken the medical capabilities at each of our training centers Next we will implement a two week period of controlled monitoring for each basic combat training cycle before beginning their eight week training program of instruction referred to as the training model Throughout the process we will refine our cadre and support staff monitoring and screening processes We hold the safety of our force and our communities in the highest regard We will move soldiers from our training centers onto follow on training locations or their first units of assignment with a strictly controlled and rehearsed movement You have seen evidence of those procedures most recently in pictures from Fort Sill OK and Fort Jackson SC Most importantly I could not be more proud of the undaunted resolve of our Army team and our communities rallying together to battle this

talk a little bit about how you do it before you bring someone into the training base and then I ll let General Hibbard pick that up on what happens in the training base Go ahead Frank MAJOR GENERAL FRANK M MUTH Yes sir thank you for the opportunity So what we do is our recruiters start to they contact the future soldier that is waiting to ship days out and just ask the very basic questions about \u2013 have you been around any how do you feel personally do you are you running a temperature and if you ve been sick have you been around anybody sick are you sheltering in place in your house have you been out Things like that That s days But then once you get closer hours out we do the same thing again hours out we do the same thing again These are phone calls with the future soldier and hours out And then when our recruiter will meet the the future soldier to take them to the MEPS site they again screen them or ask them questions and at this point they can see them virt you know visually And by the way sometimes they ll call them or sometimes they ll Facetime them in advance It s just our recruiters use both techniques now because we\u2019ve done a lot of virtual stuff They take them to the MEPS and then the MEPS will further screen them with taking their temperature and asking those series of questions Once they get through the MEPS I ll hand it over to General Hibbard to take it from there from training Lonnie over to you MAJOR GENERAL LONNIE HIBBARD Thanks Frank I guess I ll when they get to us when they get off the bus from the MEPS we again continue the same process as so we ll do the screening questions and the temperature when they arrive in the MEPS for the ones that are correction when they arrive in the reception battalion for one to two days And then as they come out of the reception battalion we minimally in process them and move them into controlled monitoring And so for two weeks they re executed in a platoon sized element doing controlled monitoring every day which we re asking the questions and taking their temperature while they continue to do limited training for two weeks prior to prior to moving from there to our basic training And so once they get out of that days of controlled monitoring and they re now no symptoms and COVID negative we move them into what we call our controlled bubble where we begin to now do collective training GEN FUNK Thanks for that question Back to you Sunset STAFF Next I ll ask Hailey Britzky Q Yes thank you and thank you all for doing this One quick clarification how long is this pause for basic training expected to last GEN FUNK Well it s it s actually going to be conditions based The first set of is a is two weeks and then we re going to we re going to continue to assess the environment and go from there Over Q And so my my other question is General Muth maybe if you could speak about this a little bit \u2013 you\u2019ve recently announced that the Army would be moving to virtual recruiting I was wondering if you could speak a little bit about how that s been going any stumbling blocks that you may have had to work around and sort of what you ve seen as that process has carried out over the last couple of weeks MAJ GEN MUTH Hey great question So we actually positioned ourselves you know you guys remember last you know in I mean I m sure you can t forget that we didn t make mission And so the first changes we made is we went heavily into social media cause that s what the recruiters were telling us where the Z generation were where they re hanging out and no they re just they re just digitally innate folks So anyway we have been positioning ourselves in this world in the world of digital markets for about months So we made the call very early to transition from being physically in the recruiting stations to going percent virtual We made the call on the 15th of March And so there haven t there s been some minor stumbling blocks within a couple of days and that was really just getting the authorities to do more of what we call processing of applicants over Facetime And that s the ability to get use Facetime and instead of physically being in the same room for them to sign a document we can watch them do it over the phone now and then we can swear in that that was the that person signed the document So what we re finding is there there \u2013 if the youth were on the social media before there moreso now because they re not in school So we re out there whether you know one battalion did a dance live a live dance party another one did a hangman game another one did a lot of E Sports a lot of E Sports and we re heavily into Indeed and the other work sites and Google advertisements Very very powerful And so we can get an applicant the contract percent complete virtual and they only have to do three things when we end up taking them through the MEPS for us to get them to ships Over Q General if I could I m sorry just one more follow up on this You you said a few weeks ago that some you know new soldiers were maybe had filled out their paperwork but were on a delay to ship out that you were going to start getting them to help the their local recruiting battalions so that they were kind of able to start getting paid Could you talk about how how many new soldiers are doing that and what that would look like MAJ GEN MUTH Right again again great question So we talked about that two weeks ago and you re right And so the numbers right now are very low but if you could think about it and I ll walk you through that in a sec but you have to you have to preface it with this we ve never done that before So we had to get everything lined up both policy regulation and then also the how do you actually physically doing that especially in this environment and it we did this in two weeks So last Friday we brought the first two onboard And so you know we roughly have about soldiers that need to ship Now not all of those folks are going to be brought onto the rolls What we re doing is specifically looking at each case and we re looking at the hardships that they may be under whether they ve quit their job whether they don t have an apartment now because they ve let their lease go they ve got family members all of that And we re screening them right now If they don t have that what we re doing is depending on how much they re going to be delayed in their shipping they are going to be authorized to get either a or a shipping bonus when their ship date eventually comes around And so we re trying to do something for all of these delayed shippers to ensure that based on this unexpected national emergency that they are still committed to the Army and that we re going to take care of them and it s the right thing to do Over Q Thank you STAFF Thank you sir We ll go to Matthew Cox now Q Hi thank you for doing this So I did OK I did just have two questions One of them just to clarify so right now we re on a the Army is on a two week hold or pause so no recruits are shipping to basic training That s correct GEN FUNK Yeah that s that s right April and this time in April and May are our lowest shipping months anyway And because of some of the great things that Frank put into place early on we only had about left to ship between now and the 19th of April So we re in a good spot in the Army in terms of getting the conditions set to really be ready for the summer surge Q OK thank you And then also so over the weekend DOD put out a face covering face covering guidelines So is that going on Can you talk about a little bit in the training base And what recruits or trainees are being advised to do Are they wearing face coverings everywhere then GEN FUNK The answer to your question is we re looking at each one of those As I said earlier though we re put in place social distancing as a matter of our training environment anyway So there will be very few areas where we have to use the face coverings as a routine and it s kind of where you tend to bunch up a bit and we re trying to prevent bunching up So we re we ve learned some of those social distancing lessons Will we be perfect everywhere No but where we can we re going to continue to do what it is we re doing which is stay social distance safe focused on what it is we ve got to get done And if we have to put the mask on we can do that as well We re trained to fight in every environment STAFF And now we ll go to Mike in the room Q Yeah hi General Funk it s Mike Glenn with The Washington Times Brave Rifles I ve got just a quick question You say this you re on this two week break now or a two week pause now How long can you hold onto this before it starts impacting those units downstream that are really desperate to get those those young privates GEN FUNK Well we re actually we re in great shape If you re talking readiness you know we like I said we have about in some form or fashion in the training base now so those were the recruits that were going to come for the next couple of months anyway So as we start to fill the units and generate some space we ll be able to then bring in more folks You know it s the social distancing has caused us to have to actually re look at every bit of our capacity to be able to bring in as many people as we can and still maintain social distancing So we re working through all that Right now it s not impacting readiness so we ll be able to continue with those that we have in the base now It s really about getting the the transportation in place to move them which we d been rehearsing for a number of weeks now and I think we ve got pretty good procedures in place Over Q OK STAFF We ll go back to the phones Corey Q Yes thank you General Funk can I ask you you know specifically why the message has been that shipping recruits is mission essential so why is this decision coming down today specifically And then can you update us on how many recruits in the Army pipeline have tested positive and how many cadre tested positive GEN FUNK I I can here s what I ll I will do for you Let me answer the first part of your question first or the second part of your question first The today the training trainees have been the numbers have been very low I d prefer not to push out the total number and just let DOD update you guys on the numbers as they come out But across the enterprise across the as I described in the training base permanent party across that we have somewhere in the neighborhood of total cases of which have already recovered and we re continuing to recover more every day So the numbers are low Over MAJ GEN MUTH Hey sir can I jump in on that GEN FUNK Yeah MAJ GEN MUTH first part of that question a little bit about CROSSTALK GEN FUNK Yeah you take the first part I was going to push it to you anyway MAJ GEN MUTH Yeah Thank you sir Hey so here s what we did Again starting pretty early we stood up an internal team that was our doctor and we have operational research support analysis ORSA folks that really just work in the world of numbers Because I mean recruiting comes down to a lot with numbers So we have an ideal group to be able to bring together and run models internally This was just for USAREC to inform us by county throughout the United States as certain areas went red we reduced our shipping numbers from those MEPS those counties fed into And the model was based on of course CDC the other piece of the model it was a combination It was the CDC the Washington University of Washington and Gates model and then our doc came up with what he calls a doubling model and it really just looks at the doubling rate And this had to go this was based on parts you know numbers per cases that would open up Then we included because this didn t we didn t have a model built to run the numbers we were doing it kind of by like you know it was manual We also included the government the local government s shelter in place And so as each county we would call red almost every day it started to automatically slow down the shipping because we would adjust our shipping dates based on an area going red Now that s we just went and build the model over the weekend to where now we can just we can run the program And we re doing that today And actually what we think that s going to cause is some of those counties to go back to an amber status And that ll be good enough to start setting the conditions in two weeks when we when they the Department of the Army re looks on opening it again we will be able to give them a lot more informed data based on per based on the county whether it s a green amber or red Over STAFF Great Now we ll go to Sydney Q Hello thank you all very much Let me ask I want to make sure I understand this you have the standard eight week basic training course but tacked on the front of that is two weeks of controlled status You know obviously a lot of Army life is about standing around waiting for generals to do something with you But what are people doing in those two weeks Are they being told to stand at attention stare at the wall for two weeks Or are they actually conducting some kind of training activity even though that s not part of the regular basic curriculum GEN FUNK Hey Sydney I will push the first of all very few privates are commanded around by generals but there are some great command sergeant majors in here and that s what they do every day So that s what they re paid to do On the on the end of the of your question is I think General Hibbard can explain to you that what they ll be doing for the controlled monitoring part of this but they ll be doing fitness activities so I ll just pass it over to to Lonnie MAJ GEN HIBBARD Hey Sydney it s Major General Lonnie Hibbard What we did is we pulled almost all of the academics that those trainees would have done over the weeks and we moved that to the first two weeks And so what we tried to do is we looked at all those activities that we could do in controlled monitoring that maintains social distancing So it s those academics we could either do in a classroom or outdoors maintaining social distancing and then they also do PRT in the morning So they ll get up they ll do PRT physical readiness training in the morning so it s the introduction to how the Army does its physical training so we do that in the morning and then the rest of the day is the academics So it keeps them physically and mentally engaged in that weeks And what that enables us once they get out of the controlled monitoring and they re now COVID free is we can now move into the you know from a walk phase of the academics to the run phase of the collective training and and the the team building aspect of basic combat training GEN FUNK Yeah let me just clarify Lonnie said weeks he meant days OK Did that answer your question Q Yes sir I understand So all the basically the classroom work and it serves and that would have been spread throughout the week course has been moved to this two weeks GEN FUNK Yeah that that s right Yeah that I wouldn t say all but the vast majority of it is Q Understood And now are people in classrooms I guess they re are they six feet apart And you know are they wearing cloth masks I know that you know the DOD guidance says you can do the cloth masks when you can t maintain six feet but you know everything we re hearing about aerosolization you know and you know how this spreads through you know some very light droplets suggesting you probably want to have both of those things at least if you re indoors where the air is constantly circulating MAJ GEN HIBBARD Yeah Sydney What we ve directed is is all classes that can be executed outdoors will be executed outdoors That s the first priority So we want to move things outdoors first For those days that we can t execute outdoors due to weather based on how we re filling right now at percent is we can maintain the social distancing in the classrooms to maintain the six feet between trainees and between instructors and the trainees And then when they can t then as General Funk mentioned earlier we ll look at how we re using the gaiters or other cloth type face masks GEN FUNK Yeah and on the other side of that if you re displaying any symptoms you re going to be isolated further from the group anyway So that that s a third check in that system Q Of course you don t have any of the actual antibody tests And we know this as those are in scarce supply I presume we don t have that as part of your process because nobody does And that and of course we have a lot of asymptomatic cases it looks like in the around the world as well so that s an issue I don t know how one addresses that GEN FUNK Yeah that s why we re using the two week controlled monitoring STAFF OK we ll move to Ryan in the room Q Thank you ma am Ryan Browne with CNN General the decision to pause the shipping of new recruits was that made because of an outbreak at one of the locations And was that decision technically come into force today or did that come into force yesterday or the day before GEN FUNK No it actually came in today but it really became because this was the prime time as I described to how low you had of shipping numbers anyway It would just made sense to do that so we could thicken our capabilities and make sure we got all the good processes in place coordinate for for patient elements and and check their processes too so that we can move folks as we need to So it was really just happened to be that this is the the lowest time for shipping in the Army and this is the right time to do it Q And then has there been any other pauses or in terms of onward training So once they ve completed basic are you kind of slowing down them going into the specialization training or any other is there any similar pauses kind of to prevent folks moving around and possibly spreading the pandemic GEN FUNK No we once we have them in safety bubble and then we put them into clean transportation we take them on to their advanced individual training And then from there we re doing the same thing to take them to their first unit of assignment so we re actually coordinating for organizations to be able to help us in those regards Q Has that been challenging to kind of is that requiring a lot more resourcing to kind of maintain these bubbles You know we we heard one example of no more contractor feeding for some units being trained I mean how difficult is that transition GEN FUNK Yeah well it certainly puts an increased load on us that that s for sure But you know the Army we re designed to adapt and overcome these kinds of obstacles so that we re just doing it That s what we have to do and so the bottom line is in order to maintain the readiness of the Army we ve got to figure out these processes and procedures get them in place and give us the best chance of making sure we re ready for any contingency Q Thank you STAFF We ll go back to the phone lines Jaspreet Q Thank you General Funk there was a guidance put out April 3rd authorizing the use of virtual battle assemblies for all Army Reserve troop program unit commands Can you speak a little bit about that and what potential impacts on readiness this may have GEN FUNK Well I think that first of all that that decision for the Guard and the Reserve I would have to let the commanders of both the Guard and the Reserve give you specifics about that But I do think it s a prudent decision to be able to do that and I do believe that those commanders have put in place the proper procedures in order to do the virtual battle assemblies But you know our Guard and Reserve have been critical in the call up of this They are wearing the uniform of the great nation out there in the public eye and right in the storm so to speak as they are in the fight with us This is a total Army effort STAFF We ve got time for one more question Terese Q Yes hi This is Terese Garnier with Newsy Thank you so much One of the reporters actually asked the question I was going to ask earlier but I do have a question about those who enlisted under signing bonuses How has the pandemic impacted how and when they will get those signing bonuses MAJ GEN MUTH So sir do you want me to jump on this one GEN FUNK Yeah go ahead Frank MAJ GEN MUTH Thank you sir Hey so here s the deal is it s not going to be impacted at all Their signing bonus actually they don t get it until they finish their training So all the bonuses that they ve signed up for even though their contract has been renegotiated and and the date has been pushed a little bit farther down the road we will still honor all their their bonuses Over Q Thank you STAFF All right General Funk over to you for any closing comments GEN FUNK I don t have any real closing comments other than to say you know to the American people your Army s equal to this challenge It is a total Army effort It is a total Army force taking after this and we at Army Training and Doctrine Command are will ensure that we we do the best we can to ensure that the nation s treasure it s sons and daughters are better are better trained and ready to do anything anywhere at any time Thank you for your time today I really appreciate it STAFF Thank you sir Thank you ladies and gentlemen",

Sandboxx If you love military movies then it\u2019s safe to say you\u2019d recognize Max Martini While his film career doesn\u2019t only include military centric roles he\u2019s built a reputation among the military community as both a proud supporter of service members and one of the most badass actors ever to portray them on screen I first remember recognizing Max Martini as a mil actor way back during his days filming \u201cThe Unit \u201d a popular CBS TV series about elite special operators assigned to 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment Delta SFOD D commonly known by those of us outside their elite fraternity as Delta Force Since then Max has played warfighters of all sorts in fan favorite movies like Saving Private Ryan Hours Spectral Captain Phillips and one of my favorite sci fi movies Pacific Rim Max Martini in \u201cSaving Private Ryan\u201d Dreamworks Pictures His most recent foray into the military genre was Sgt Will Gardner The film depicts a Marine veteran who has struggled since separating from service and is now trying to re establish a relationship with his young son The movie was a passion project for Max who wrote produced directed and acted in the titular role Importantly however making the movie wasn\u2019t just about telling a powerful story about service and redemption it was also about helping veterans in the real world He\u2019s pledged of the film\u2019s profits to veteran charities I was fortunate enough to get to sit down with Max digitally during this Coronavirus quarantine and ask him some questions about his career his work on behalf of the military and veteran communities and just what it takes to play some of the most badass characters ever put on screen Max has played both real and fictional Special Operators and has made a name for himself among veterans for it I asked Max what keeps him coming back to these sorts of challenging roles \u201cMy dad was an artist living in New York City so I sorta grew up in the Arts But that said my mother was a cop I grew up in the arts went to art school got my degree in fine arts and came out owing ya know a hundred and fifty gazillion dollars without a way to pay it off \u201d Max explained \u201cI got asked to audition for a movie because I\u2019d dabbled in acting and then the second movie I got was Saving Private Ryan That was transformational for me I had just graduated from art school and I didn\u2019t have much of a sense of politics or appreciation for the military Then I did this movie and I really started to understand more about our service members and I really loved the community because there was obviously a lot of former military involved in making that movie \u201d Martini on Hours It wasn\u2019t just that he developed an appreciation for service through filming Saving Private Ryan he also quickly established himself as a solid actor capable of playing military roles \u201cI don\u2019t know it\u2019s like Steven Spielberg gives you this stamp of approval that says \u2018okay he makes a good soldier \u2019 and everybody jumps on board \u201d Max joked Of course because Max has played a member of Delta Force before I felt the need to speak to one of my friends that actually served in that elite unit to see what he\u2019d be interested to learn about acting in such a role So I gave legendary Delta Force operator George E Hand IV a call\u2013and he wanted to know how actors like Max go about playing military roles in a realistic way on screen \u201cWell I think it\u2019s a combination of things Like for instance when I did Captain Phillips we had a technical advisor from the Navy but it wasn\u2019t somebody showing you how to soldier it was somebody showing you the functionality of the ship \u201d he recalled \u201cBut the guys around me were all former special operations team guys and they\u2019d be like \u2018Dude you should say this \u2019 One of the guys was about to relieve the team that was on the ship that took the shot so he was familiar with the operation \u201d He went on to talk about his time specifically playing a Delta Force operator in The Unit \u201cThe Unit was adapted from a book that Eric Haney wrote He was one of the original Delta guys So Eric was a producer on the show and he put us through a lot of training and then he was there every day to watch over us technically \u201d Max points out that his resume isn\u2019t all that helps him win military roles Now he\u2019s close friends with a number of veterans and does a lot of firearm training on his own He might do it because it\u2019s fun but the technical capability he develops by shooting with special operations veterans tend to translate into his realistic handling of weapons on screen \u201cI think that\u2019s also a consideration when people hire me People go \u2018we\u2019re not going to have to do much with him to get him ready for the show \u2019 Max\u2019s appreciation for service members isn\u2019t just born out of his real life friendships with veterans He\u2019s also made a number of trips overseas to visit deployed service members Max\u2019s decision to donate of

investigation in found that thousands of girls and women in Bangladeshi red light districts had been trafficked into brothel prostitution as children and that many women working in the sex trade were trapped in debt bondage \u201cWe don\u2019t earn much here I make enough to survive day to day and most of us are in debt \u201d said one year old woman who has worked in a brothel in Goalanda for more than seven years \u201cWhat will happen if things don\u2019t get better Yesterday I needed to get some food but all my money is stuck in online banking apps and all the cashpoints are closed I managed to borrow some from a friend otherwise I would have been in big trouble \u201d Local government official Rubayet Hayat of the sub district of Goalanda said food and financial aid from the disaster management and relief ministry would start to be distributed by the end of this week \u201cThere are some women in the brothels under our jurisdiction We have asked for 30kgs of rice and taka

near to the brothel in Goalanda said more help would be needed to prevent an outbreak of Covid in brothels and red light districts \u201cThe brothel area is very dirty and unhygienic The rooms are inhumanly tiny The house owners built the rooms strategically for more profit so that they can fit more rooms in a small area \u201d said Zulfekar Ali the in charge doctor at the Gonoshasthaya Kendra charity hospital \u201cIn that same tiny room the sex workers live work and often cook Many share common toilets \u201d He added that many women working in the brothels are often reluctant to access healthcare services because they fear being shamed and stigmatised \u201cWe are using loud hailers to spread awareness in the brothels telling the women who are there to wash their hands properly

Service Academies Cope With COVID-19", "text": "People all over the world are dealing with life changes that have occurred due to the coronavirus pandemic and that includes students at the nation s storied military academies Thousands of students attend the five U S service academies \u2014 the Military Academy in West Point New York the Naval Academy in Annapolis Maryland the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs Colorado the Coast Guard Academy in New London Connecticut and the Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point New York Discipline and routine are essential for those students but both were upended in mid March when COVID began to spread across the country Most students were on spring break when social distancing rules went into place so academy leaders extended those breaks until they were able to get distance learning up and running The Air Force Academy which was the only school not on spring break at the time sent its underclassmen home There are always some students for whom going home isn t an option and accommodations have been made for their continued learning Each school has a yearly sponsorship program in which local families help take care of the students who can t get home to their relatives Those families have stepped up during the COVID pandemic as well A lot of those sponsor families have still been kind enough to host some of those students Coast Guard Academy spokesman Cmdr Dave Milne said By late March students at all five academies were set up with resources to finish their coursework online Students have adjusted relatively well officials said despite having to adapt to challenges such as time zones missing equipment and the occasional spotty internet connection I live on a rural farm in Ohio and we have satellite internet said West Point Cadet Edmund Coleman who will graduate this year As a result sometimes if the weather s bad I don t have great access to the online meetings Most of my teachers have anticipated that and they ve recorded lessons and put them online so that I can view them when I do get the internet back As of now it hasn t really been an issue The challenges are forcing many to get creative One West Point teacher set up a show and tell portion of his class to get the students to interact more But there have still been some frustrations especially for graduating seniors who have questions that so far remain open ended They seniors had some capstone projects in the works and a lot of questions preparing for their next assignments and permanent change of station moves Milne said But they understand and \u2026 they ve been really open and grateful and flexible All service academy students have been encouraged to keep up their physical training as well whether on their own or through school resources Each academy has created online workouts and exercise sessions for students to access Many spring and summer activities at the schools have been canceled including sporting events Even some commissioning ceremonies are still in question The Air Force Academy graduated its cadets early on April The ceremony which was moved up by more than a month allowed the Class of to celebrate together albeit without any of the annual precommissioning festivities The graduates \u2014 including the first batch of Space Force officers \u2014 stood feet apart to maintain social distancing guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID Family and friends were not allowed to attend but they were able to watch online West Point announced in late April that its graduation which was initially scheduled for May would be pushed to June when President Donald J Trump will serve as the commencement speaker The school said graduating cadets are expected to return to campus in time for the ceremony which will involve unspecified changes from previous ceremonies due to current circumstances The size and scope of the graduation ceremony will be determined by safety considerations for cadets and the entire West Point community the school s Public Affairs Office said in a statement Academy leadership is conducting a thorough analysis and plan for the safe return of the Corps of Cadets The Naval Academy also canceled its commissioning week traditions including the popular Herndon Monument climb Students and their families were told in mid April that graduation would remain on its original date of May but it will now be virtual Vice Adm Sean S Buck the Naval Academy superintendent is encouraging graduates to have private swearing in ceremonies that they can share with the school The Coast Guard Academy announced last week it will hold a virtual graduation on May its original date Milne said they re still working out the details including soliciting ideas from first class cadets Officials at the Merchant Marine Academy which commissions many of its graduates into the armed forces said they are still considering their options The academy runs on trimesters so its graduation ceremonies are usually held in late June Despite all the upheaval the pandemic has caused the schools and their students are doing what many of them train to do \u2014 stay prepared and be flexible", "page_url":

an automatic extension through September while some other ID card updates and enrollments are now permitted by fax or mail according to new Pentagon guidance The changes are designed to help military families and retirees avoid visiting base ID card offices during the novel coronavirus pandemic the memo states The change was announced in an April memo sent to the service chiefs and signed by Matthew Donovan under secretary for personnel and readiness Typically dependent and retiree military ID card enrollments and updates must be done in person at one of the Pentagon s ID card offices While some paperwork can be signed and turned in electronically cards must generally be retrieved in person Normally expired ID cards can be confiscated at base gates and military children over the age of are required to have their own card The Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System DEERS manages personnel information across the Defense Department including keeping track of when benefits expire and who is currently enrolled Related The Latest on the Military s COVID Response To ensure DoD ID card offices are postured to maintain continuity of operations and to minimize the number of non essential required visits at DoD ID card offices the following guidance is in effect through September the memo states The new ID changes include ID card expiration date will be extended If a user is still enrolled in DEERS their ID card will be valid through Sept regardless of the printed expiration date the guidance states If a user is no longer enrolled their ID card expiration date will not be extended Base officials will review enrollment Rather than simply confiscate an expired ID base officials including gate guards will first confirm whether the holder is still enrolled in DEERS Some ID cards will be available by mail order How ID cards will be issued by mail varies by service The memo allows new family member enrollment as well as eligibility updates and first time or replacement ID cards to be processed remotely by mailing or faxing copies of documents and application forms Users should mail only copies of their official documents such as marriage or birth certificates not originals ID cards issued by mail will typically be set to expire in one year Although individual services might have their own rules the memo requires the cards to last no more than a year Currently ID cards are automatically set to expire every four years To stay enrolled users will be required to bring the original versions of their ID documents to an ID card facility The age when children must get a military ID card is raised Currently military kids must get an ID when they turn years old The memo bumps that age to Guard and Reserve family members should keep their current ID cards When a Guardsman or reservist is mobilized their families typically are issued a different ID card reflecting that status The memo instructs those families to instead keep their current IDs Unlike dependent and retiree ID cards common access cards CAC used by uniformed troops and Pentagon civilian employees must still be obtained in person within days of their expiration date according to the memo The guidance also puts on hold receiving a new CAC due to rank or name changes ID card facilities typically issue between and military ID cards each day the memo states Just how users should go about turning in information for their mail order ID cards varies by service The Army for example wants users to first contact their nearest Real Time Automated Personnel Identification System RAPIDS ID card office to receive instructions on where to mail their documents The Marine Corps plans to process new enrollments by mail only and will require families to re enroll with their original documents within days of being issued their ID Contact information for ID card offices can be found on the RAPIDS website A full list of required documents and available

developed by the T manufacturer Ural Vagon Zavod UVZ enterprise The plant located at Yekaterinburg in the Ural region is one of two major tank manufacturers in Russia a producer of tanks since the T T to the Armata family MBT The first batch of T 90M tanks delivered to a Russian Army unit The latest upgraded version of the T \u2013 the Proryv Breakthrough T 90M has recently completed field tests by the Russian Ministry of Defense commencing deliveries to field units In April the Russian MOD reported the first deliveries to the Tamanskaya Motor Rifle Division a unit of the Guard Tank Army deployed in the Western Region The unit and its new tanks are expected to take part in the May victory parade in Moscow In the coming years the Russian Army is also fielding upgraded variants of the T72M T72B3M and T80BVM The Russian MOD plans to upgrade T 90s to the new standard deferring mass production of Armata tanks due to their high cost These tanks provide a temporary solution addressing capability gaps and technological advancement before deploying next generation AFVs such as the T While the next generation tanks are already developed they still face technical hurdles and are too expensive for large scale procurement The cost of T Armata MBT is estimated at US million compared to million the cost of an upgraded T Nevertheless the T 90M benefits from technological achievements and systems implemented in the expensive export version T 90MS and the Armata MBT Some of the outstanding new features of the T 90M are a new turret mounting an improved version of the 2A46 125mm stabilized cannon Improved precision derives from the muzzle drop measurement and fire control systems borrowed from the new T Armata tank This cannon fires kinetic rounds that are longer and faster than previous rounds thus being able to penetrate thicker armor The fire control is programmed to fire three types of rounds \u2013 High speed Kinetic APFSDS HEAT AT and High Explosive airburst fragmentation projectile used against soft targets and structures Gun launched anti tank missiles of the 9M119 Svir Refleks family NATO Reporting Name AT SNIPER are used against targets at ranges up to meters The tank can also use the entire range of older ammunition The side of the turret of T 90M showing Relikt armor laser warning units and smoke canisters part of the tank\u2019s self defense

machine gun is placed near the commander\u2019s cupola and is controlled by the crew from inside the vehicle This method was also employed in the T and T 90MS The turret shape enabled designers to increase the ammunition stowage by to a total of rounds of which \u2013 pairs of projectiles and propelling charges are placed in the automatic loader\u2019s carousel plus missiles The remaining rounds and propelling charges are stored in a new turret bustle rather than in the crew compartment thus avoiding the risk of explosion Related post New KE Ammunition for Russian Tanks Another new system implemented here is the Kalina automatic target tracker and fire control computer developed for the T This system enables the gunner to lay the gun on target lock and automatically fire while on the move Gunner\u2019s sight and fire control Visibility from inside the tank is provided by the commander\u2019s sight right panoramic views left showing the views of four cameras mounted on the meteorological Standard optical vision blocks provide back up viewing around the turret The tank has an independent panoramic commander\u2019s sight with day night channels The gunner uses a separate sight laser rangefinder and a missile director associated with the beam riding gun launched REFLEKS missiles The lack of soft or hard kill APS hints the Russian Army has been satisfied with the level of protection its new tank provides The level of protection of the T 90M has been improved to defeat kinetic threats capable of penetrating to mm and shaped charge threats penetrating up to mm of rolled homogenous steel RHS Additional protection layer was added to withstand such threats comprising steel plates added with the rd generation reactive protection known as RELIKT Additional protection using statistical protection is added around the turret and engine compartment at the rear The lower sections of the turret sides and rear are applied with net shaped RPG protection with slat type armor applied to the engine compartment sides and rear The type can also use large reactive protection bags applied to the sides on top of the bazooka plates protecting against roadside IEDs and EFP T 90M firing Note the flat panels of Relikt reactive protection and the flexible mesh type RPG protection on the side These add on armor solutions were developed based on the lessons learned during the Syrian Civil War where T tanks suffered significant losses to anti tank guided missiles and RPGs Similar configurations are also applied to T tanks and BMPT Terminator infantry support tanks While earlier T versions were equipped with the SHTORA soft kill active defense system comprised of two \u2018red eye\u2019 infra red flashlights the current variant does not use such measures Russian sources relate to it as \u2018laser countermeasures\u2019 Four units are mounted on the turret two units are pointed forward and two sideways Further protection is provided by the 81mm multi spectral canisters deploying smoke screens which can be triggered by the laser warning An interesting note is the lack of hard kill active protection means The Russian MOD has evaluated several types of APS including ARENA on T and AFGANIT on T T and other AFVs It has been confirmed that models of the T 90SM have been equipped with APS addressing foreign interest but apparently lack of such interest in Moscow has left the T 90M without such protection The new design also reduces the tank\u2019s signature especially in the thermal reduction of engine exhaust heat With the hp engine up from hp of the T 90S the ton vehicle has a power to weight ratio thus maintaining good mobility and obstacle crossing capability particularly when assisted with the integral dozer blade assisting the tank in digging up firing positions For mobility in muddy terrain tank units employ tree log barricades built from trunks carried on each tank Traditionally these trunks are placed in the rear but the T 90M carries its log on the starboard side right side thus enabling a quick release T 90M down range Photo Defense Update Measurements Gross Vehicle Weight kg Length Chassis only m Width m Height m

real estate deals setting up the world s biggest skydiving meets and building a private air force the likes of which even he has a hard time believing is possible Just last month The War Zone was among the first to report that his company would be purchasing multiple squadrons worth of surplus Royal Australian Air Force RAAF F A Hornets to be used in the contractor adversary air support role here in the United States In that role they would primarily fly against U S military fighter pilots replicating aerial threats from potential enemy nations So basically they are bad guys for hire but strictly for training and development work Now not only do we have all the details on that purchase which is even more impressive than it initially seemed but we talked at length with the entrepreneur owner of Air USA located in Quincy Illinois about his company s past and what is turning into a remarkable if not downright historic future Don Kirlin imported his first foreign military jet and L Albatross in at a time when doing so was an extremely complex and convoluted affair full of pitfalls and unknowns Since then he has repeated the process dozens of times over and was the first owner of a private MiG Fulcrum in the United States among a long list of other exotic flying firsts He now holds eight licenses with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms ATF allowing him to own military machine guns and cannons as well as thousands of rounds of ammunition to fire through them Air USA Don Kirlin with members of his Air USA team He was also one of the early pioneers of the then fledgling if not wholly experimental adversary air support market In the early 2000s he joined forces with the Airborne Tactical Advantage Company ATAC which was blazing a trail with their contracts with the Navy to supply fast jet targets and electronic warfare pod toting adversaries that mimic everything from enemy cruise missiles to fighters for Navy and Marine fighter aircraft and Navy surface combatants to train against During those early years Air USA worked as a subcontractor for ATAC flying the vast majority of the contracted subsonic adversary support flight hours So Kirlin and his company s experience in what is now an exploding adversary support marketplace dates back to its very genesis Air USA Prior to the Hornet purchase Kirlin s most outlandish import was not just one but four MiG Fulcrums He was the first private owner of one of these jets in the United States Fast forward to today and Kirlin now owns an impressive fleet of ex military aircraft that perform a wide number of roles for the Defense Department from training Joint Terminal Attack Controllers JTACs the modern designation for Forward Air Controllers on the ground to saturating the sensor systems of America s most advanced tactical fighters with aggressor adversaries in the air With the individual contracts that will underpin the Air Force s gargantuan adversary air support tender about to doled out Air USA s operation has to grow in capacity and complexity in order to even attempt to meet demand Enter the most spectacular private aircraft purchase of all time\u2014Air USA s acquisition of all of the Royal Australian Air Force s remaining F A 18A B Hornets Canada had bought prior to this deal going through The jets Air USA is slated to receive in total of which are flying today will be replaced by the F 35A Joint Strike Fighter within the RAAF s ranks and thus will be totally retired from service by the end of \u00a9 Commonwealth of Australia Department of Defence Aussie F A 18A B Hornets and their replacements F 35As Although the terms of the deal have not been disclosed the purchase does include all of the RAAF s F A spare parts inventory and test equipment valued at over a billion dollars alone according to Kirlin Those parts will be incredibly valuable as Air USA is planning on putting every single airframe it receives back into service\u2014not just the aircraft that are flyable today but the other that are not as well Those jets just need inspections and are not parted out or grounded for any other reasons This will allow Air USA to operate at least three fully outfitted squadrons of the 4th generation fighters at all times which Kirlin hopes will be forward deployed to key bases around the United States where they will primarily help give fleet pilots testers and tactics developers a run for their money in the air to air combat arena \u00a9 Commonwealth of Australia Department of Defence These are not Hornets in some dated configuration either The RAAF spent a lot of money keeping its legacy Hornet fleet relevant until replacements arrived One of the most important capabilities the jets come with is the bolt on Elta EL L license built in the U S under the L3Harris Advanced Capability Pod name electronic warfare pod These Israeli designed pods are pretty much the world standard in modular self protection jamming systems and are used on the Pentagon s own aggressor fleet as well as by various nations around the globe on frontline aircraft You can learn just how powerful this system is being able to turn even highly antiquated aircraft into formidable and deadly aerial threats especially when paired with unique tactics in this past piece of ours All of Air USA s secondhand Hornets feature the AN APG radar \u2014the same one that is found on the F A 18C D and early F A 18E F Super Hornets\u2014that differs from the less capable AN APG radar the A B Hornet was originally equipped with The AN APG remains a very capable radar set and is largely superior to anything else on the adversary market at this time Kirlin also informs us that the radar and electronic warfare pod are integrated in such a way that the aircraft can simultaneously jam and engage jam and shoot enemy targets which he doesn t believe exists anywhere else on the adversary market and is a critical capability when it comes to mimicking more advanced foreign fighter threats Raytheon AN APG Radar in the nose of an F A Hornet The jets also come with their Northrop Grumman AN AAQ LITENING advanced targeting pods which are hugely capable in the air to ground targeting and non traditional reconnaissance realm as well as for positively identifying aircraft visually at long ranges You can read all about this function and its value in this past piece of ours In addition the Hornets come with Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Systems JHMCS which offers helmet mounted display capability that drastically increases a pilot s situational awareness and high off boresight targeting for close range air to air missiles This will make it easier for these aggressor jets to simulate foreign capabilities of a similar nature \u00a9 Commonwealth of Australia Department of Defence A RAAF Hornet pilot wearing their JHMCS helmet mounted display Overall Kirlin informs us that that the Aussie Hornets are being imported in exactly the same configuration as they are flying operationally today the RAAF Nothing is being removed even the jet s Link data link system and its internal M61 20mm Vulcan cannon are staying put As for the condition of the surplus Hornet fleet Kirlin says they are in incredible shape and show little signs of corrosion\u2014likely a result of their often hot and dry operating environment down under as opposed to the salty conditions aboard aircraft carriers that U S Navy Hornets have had to endure \u00a9 Commonwealth of Australia Department of Defence An Aussie F A Hornet in its latest advanced configuration carrying the AN AAQ LITENING advanced targeting pod and Elta EL L electronic warfare pod as well as JDAMs and an AMRAAM of the fighters have had their center barrel sections replaced \u2014a critical structural upgrade that is necessary once Hornets hit a certain level of fatigue\u2014but the rest of the fleet shouldn t need them Kirlin says that since the aircraft have never trapped landed aboard or launched off a carrier which causes extreme stress on the airframes they should be able to operate continuously through and possibly even beyond \u00a9 Commonwealth of Australia Department of Defence The first aircraft will be heading in Air USA s direction soon For transport the jets have their outer wings and horizontal stabilizers removed but that s all the dismantling needed They will be shipped via ocean freighter and it will only take about days from arrival to get them in the air The rest of the flyable airframes will be flown in batches across the Pacific with the help of a tanker and will be ready for operations shortly after they arrive in the United States The last that are grounded due to lack of inspections will come over last As for what the jets will look like once they lose their RAAF roundels and become Air USA jets Air USA s owner wasn t entirely sure but he does like the paint on one of his MiG 29s which could be replicated on at least some of the Hornets He also mentioned that a jet black Hornet would be fun to have just for the heck of it Air USA One of the company s two MiG 29UBs in a blue gray and teal camouflage pattern Kirlin says that he looked at all the aircraft his competitors have bought especially the Mirage F 1s from Spain and France and Atlas Cheetahs from South Africa that his competitors ATAC and Draken USA have snapped up and passed on them He actually showed me the approved ATF forms for importing these jets dated years ago as proof of his claim Three primary reasons were behind his decisions The first was concern that they simply weren t the right plane for the job\u2014he wanted something more advanced Second that working with certain foreign original equipment manufacturers OEMs would be a major hassle Finally he is a firm believer in buying flyers not aircraft that have been mothballed for years if at all possible With this in mind the Hornets offered Kirlin a ready to go advanced air force in a box that wouldn t be a huge hassle to regenerate once they reached the United States They would also have great support from a domestic OEM\u2014Boeing\u2014and support and maintenance could be outsourced to firms that are already doing so for some Marine and Navy Hornet operations Air USA Kirlin after checking out South Africa s Atlus Cheetahs The balance between cost and capabilities is a huge factor in the adversary air support marketplace Does having the most advanced private tactical aircraft on hand for hire mean they will be too costly for the Pentagon s tastes This has turned out to be the case in at least one limited contract that the Navy recently awarded but Kirlin doesn t think so overall He says his team did a deep market evaluation and cost analysis on what legacy Hornets cost to operate including using the Navy s own historic numbers provided by the General Accounting Office as well as looking at what the competition has to offer and the results were very positive But for Air USA the strategy isn t really about simply having the best and most capable jet on the ramp it is all about offering the customer a big menu of choices and allowing them to tailor their aircraft selection based on their needs not on what is being offered alone This is where Air USA s growing diverse fleet of aircraft comes in to play Right now the company s budding air force includes Hawks four L 39ZAs and two L 39s The Hawk jet trainers which originally came from South Korean stocks are deceptively capable aircraft Like all of the Hawk family they are quick and nimble as well as reliable and efficient but they now also pack one hell of a sensor and electronic warfare capability The jets have been upgraded with Elta s ELM active electronically scanned array AESA radar In fact they are the only private adversary aircraft equipped with an AESA radar set at this time Air USA The ELM is a modular design of Israeli origin that can fit within the tight confines of smaller tactical fighter aircraft radomes but it is known to be remarkably effective and gives fleet pilots something unique to train against in the adversary air to air environment The jets are also wired to handle the EL L electronic warfare pods like their soon to be Hornet stablemates Combined with their small size they are a remarkably formidable and highly dissimilar adversary aircraft Air USA ELM AESA radar and EL L electronic warfare equipped Hawk The L 39ZA which is a combat capable derivative of the L Albatross trainer and the L 39s themselves have lower performance than the Hawk but they are very efficient and still can lug different types of countermeasure pods cannons and other stores Air USA has even equipped some of them with advanced electro optical and infrared sensor turrets Air USA had Dornier Alpha Jets that fell into a category somewhere between the Hawks and the L 39s but those aircraft were sold to the Nigerian Air Force which was in urgent need of the type Air USA Air USA Air USA L59 equipped with a towed target on the ramp in Okinawa The target unspools behind the aircraft on feet of cable It is used for live fire training and testing in this case of the Navy s major surface combatants inch deck guns and 20mm Phalanx CIWS In addition to the Aussie Hornet purchase Air USA also acquired five hand picked PC turboprop trainers from the RAAF These aircraft will primarily be used to fulfill the growing demand for cost effective Joint Terminal Attack Controller training You can read all about this mission and the contracts being tendered to supply it in this recent piece of ours \u00a9 Commonwealth of Australia Department of Defence Basically JTACs need to get time on the mic with real aircraft overhead in both day and nighttime conditions to get accustomed to organizing the three dimensional airspace overhead in relation to the battlespace on the ground and effectively safely and efficiently call in airstrikes on enemy targets This is an incredibly complex and high stakes job but using high performance fighters in the Pentagon s inventory that cost at least an hour to train with is horribly cost ineffective As such being able to provide far less expensive assets via the contractor marketplace for some of this training has become a major priority Air USA One of Air USA s L 39ZAs equipped with an advanced EO IR turret for Joint Terminal Attack Controller training This is not only where the PC 9s come in but also the fleet of highly modified Cessna T337 Turbo Skymasters that Air USA just acquired from Airscan Inc These aircraft were totally reworked for overhead surveillance and counter insurgency missions in places like Iraq and Afghanistan They come equipped with the hugely capable MX infrared electro optical sensor turret and an operator s station in the back The Cessnas which have a pair of reciprocating turbocharged IO engines found on normal light planes are extremely efficient compared to their turbine powered competitors and feature video downlink encrypted communications and night vision goggle compatible cockpits among other modifications They are also certified under the FAA s Standard category not the Experimental category even with all their modifications which has a multitude of benefits DTOM Wikicommons Airscan Inc T337 Turbo Skymaster Air USA s idea here is to provide the lowest possible cost for JTAC training while still having an aircraft that has all the bells and whistles needed to accomplish the mission Don Kirlin says that from his firm s perspective for a lot of JTAC training the customer just wants the most time on the mic for their JTACs as possible Delivering a very low cost option one with extremely high endurance to accomplish just that is the impetus behind acquiring the highly unique fleet of suped up and battle proven Turbo Skymasters Kirlin also states that the company has acquired F 5E Tiger IIs that will slot in between the Hawk and the Hornet in the aggressor role These jets will be totally refurbished and will get a comprehensive upgrade very similar if not nearly identical to the one Tactical Air another adversary air support purveyor has developed for its large fleet of F 5s You can read all about Tactical Air and its highly customized F 5ATs in this recent piece of ours Don Kirlin and some of his Air USA team on a repositioning flight in the Western Pacific Kirlin hopes to fit their F 5s with Infrared Search and Track Systems IRSTs which will be a huge force multiplier for other aggressors flying alongside them and a real threat to stealthy blue air jets like the F F and B Leveraging a similar open architecture avionics upgrade that Tactical Air pioneered with its F 5ATs will allow far easier integration of an IRST on the F than on other aircraft in the Air USA fleet The company also owns a quartet of MiG Fulcrums that Kirlin imported These jets are basically in factory new condition They each have roughly just hours on them now which is basically nothing The two single seat models are more parts donors than flying aircraft with the pair of two seat MiG 29UBs being airworthy Although some may wonder why these jets are not used for adversary support roles they simply are not in demand for a number of reasons They are not specifically equipped for the mission do not have a radar and are not the most efficient flying machines available for the task by a long shot They have done some missile work with Raytheon air to air missile system development in the past and could be pushed into service if a customer really wanted them but when you have fully upgraded Hornets in your fleet who needs a dated MiG With such a varied inventory of aircraft Air USA s unique business aimed at the ballooning contractor tactical air services market can be summed up by the following give the customer a huge range of options to tailor to their budget and training requirements In other words this is not a one size fits all air force for hire Quite the opposite For instance for basic air to air missions like radar intercept training maybe a PC or L is fine For other more dynamic fighter training maybe a Hawk or F will do For the most advanced air to air training the Hornet will be available The customer only has to pay for what they really need The same can be said for JTAC training For basic training scenarios a T337H gives a tremendous amount of capability for the dollar and for dry CAS where weapons are not employed but for more advanced scenarios where weapons are released PC 9s or even L 39s or Hawks would be the aircraft for the job Air USA Air USA s Hawks came with 30mm ADEN cannon pods which are fully functional and are used in close air support exercises Kirlin told us he has training rounds high explosive rounds for the cannons So it s all about choice This business mantra is something Don Kirlin learned by putting on the world s largest skydiving festival the World Freefall Convention When I say large I mean large Kirlin tells us that during a past iteration of the event skydivers made jumps in just days Many of those skydivers were sick of the same old jump ships they wanted a variety of exotic platforms to choose from to enhance their experience Over years of putting on the event Kirlin ended up bringing in everything from World War II bombers to a high flying to help quelch attendees demands By offering so many creative possibilities he found that the customer really appreciates options and wants to be able to pay for exactly what they need or desire nothing more and nothing less This emphasis on customer choice is now being ported over to the adversary air support market via his eclectic fleet of tactical aircraft for hire With choice and platform diversity also comes some really exciting opportunities to layer in different capabilities on a single adversary mission which can provide more challenging scenarios for trainees For instance pairing the Hawk with the Hornet the Hawk can share its AESA radar targeting information with the Hornet and vice versa Throw in an F with an IRST and even the stealthiest opponents will be prone to detection from Air USA s aggressor formation Layering in other aircraft like L 39s acting as cruise missiles and more will help really rachet up the complexity that blue air forces will have to confront and all of these capabilities can come from one business relationship Air USA An impressive lineup of electronic warfare toting Air USA Albatrosses With frontline fighter aircraft becoming increasingly capable especially in terms of the sensors they carry being able to challenge them has become far more difficult and often requires a mix of high performance opposing fighters as well as saturating them with other less complex aerial targets Having a turn key air force for hire with a huge range of capabilities and performance levels available makes this easier to accomplish in an efficient and integrated manner and without the Air Force Navy or Marines having to task their own overtaxed fleets with the mission Also contracting out these services already is more cost effective than having the military perform them but with tailorable forces like Kirlin s the cost should only go down not up Don Kirlin is truly living what would have been a far fetched dream not too long ago He is a man with his own fourth generation fighter equipped air force one larger and more capable than what many entire nations possess With the introduction of the F A Hornet into the adversary air support marketplace especially the number Air USA is bringing to the fight it could very well be a game changer but it also presents risks Taking on a supercarrier s worth of modern strike fighters is a hugely expensive proposition It is also one that is not without its own physical and liability risks There will be a lot of pressure on Air USA to not only pay its bills which will be monumentally huge but also to operate these extremely high performance jets in a safe and reliable manner From what I can tell Don Kirlin seems raring to take these challenges head on and to get himself strapped into the Hornet s ejection seat and taking one up for a spin\u2014he is type rated and flies every plane he owns The Hornet will be no different Call it a perk of the job for the man who now owns the world s most advanced private air force

ll form the cadre of the new service W e are incredibly excited about being a part of that said senior cadet Aaron Brooks a Birmingham Mich native who turned his eyes toward the stars during his freshman year at the academy We will really create a 21st century service he pledged The service created in December is the first new Pentagon branch created since the Air Force was formed in And until the cadets take their oath Space Force has just two members a general and a sergeant But cadets are especially prepared to join Space Force The academy is the only school in the world where undergraduates build launch and fly their own fleet of satellites And those satellites including FalconSat launched in are no hobbyist toys The spacecraft carry out real world experiments for the Air Force Research Laboratory and help guide military leaders as they adopt new technologies Space Force chief Gen Jay Raymond has already come by the academy to give a pep talk to his new lieutenants It

fifth member of her family to join the military Nimmo enlisted in the Air Force and served in medical administration before commanders recommended her for the academy We think it is pretty cool that we will partake in such a historic moment she said of her fellow Space Force cadets The from the academy will head to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California after graduation for a six month crash course on space operations Getting them into the space service despite the coronavirus was a key reason academy leaders decided to hold graduation six weeks early Coronavirus has changed many things at the academy In March the academy sent three quarters of its cadets home while keeping the seniors in isolation on the acre campus They lived on takeout meals in their dorm rooms and took online classes as they rushed to meet graduation requirements The time has been touched by tragedy Two members of the senior class died by suspected suicide in recent weeks I think for all of us it was an incredibly trying time at the academy Brooks said But the trials of pulled the senior class together Nimmo said Despite social distancing that keeps them at a safe distance from classmates the seniors have figured out ways to strengthen bonds built over four years at the school That family atmosphere built at the academy is something the cadets hope to instill in the new service they are joining The Space Force has no traditions and just a few months of history We will now be the smallest branch and the newest branch Nimmo said It will be a family At graduation they will march feet apart from their fellow cadets Hugs and high fives are out The speaker Vice President Mike Pence will give his remarks over a video link Their parents will watch online The whole ceremony a four hour affair last

darkroom for \u00a3100 or less", "text": "I\u2019ve been shooting film since the late 90s my father bought me a quirky little National when I was thirteen But I started darkroom printing just a year and a half ago in autumn What took me so long Two misconceptions mainly \u2013 that it\u2019s expensive and that it\u2019s difficult In fact it turns out that setting up a basic darkroom need not be expensive In this the first of a five part series on printing black and white photographs in a darkroom I want to illustrate just how cheap it can be \u2013 how through a combination of eBay deals and some dubious hacks I built a makeshift but fully functional darkroom in a small flat for a grand total of \u00a3 \u2026 and how you can too clickbaity but true In Part I\u2019ll try to show that basic printing is not difficult either and so much fun that it should probably be illegal Finally in Parts and I\u2019ll cover some intermediate techniques including geometric timing localised test strips split grade printing and local manipulations dodging and burning All five parts focus on traditional black and white printing on silver gelatine paper I won\u2019t go into colour printing or alternative processes And I\u2019ll focus on 35mm although some of what I say here also applies to medium and large format But first we need a darkroom So let\u2019s get started on Part also known as\u2026 Printing for millennials I use millennials as shorthand of course What I mean is printing for people like me that is people who are willing to spend a little money on the hobby but not a lot People with limited space living in rented flats People perhaps with lifestyle and career choices which entail frequently moving flats or even countries In short Part is mostly for people in the two blue areas of this Venn diagram I suppose Printing for people with limited resources who may or may not be millennials but who have an interest in analogue printing would be more accurate but somehow it\u2019s less catchy as a title Preliminaries Why I wrote this piece When I was starting out I read a lot of books and articles on how to set up a darkroom I found them informative but also intimidating Author after author described elaborate and expansive layouts with floorplans to match \u2013 a \u2018wet side\u2019 and a \u2018dry side\u2019 expensive light proofing dedicated plumbing and ventilation equipment lists running to several pages Others were openly discouraging A Guardian article advised Don\u2019t bother with home wet printing unless you have the space to create a \u2018proper\u2019 darkroom \u2026 Any attempt to produce photographs in your bathroom or kitchen is sure to end in domestic disharmony But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way In The Education of a Photographer Leo Rubinfien describes visiting Garry Winogrand in the 1970s I went to Garry\u2019s apartment which was small and dark and I was astonished to find his enlarger crammed into an alcove in the second bedroom between the bed and the wall He would darken the room and stand there and expose a big stack of prints then take them down to the darkroom in the art department at the university and develop them in the communal trays in which lots of students were doing their work at the same time Nadar \u00e9levant la Photographie \u00e0 la hauteur de l\u2019Art Nadar elevating Photography to Art Honor\u00e9 Daumier Wikimedia Commons public domain The further back you go the crazier it gets In the early 1900s Frank Hurley official photographer for the Shackleton expedition set up a darkroom in an Antarctic hut And in the 1850s Nadar satirically portrayed in the lithograph above developed collodion wet plates in mid air while soaring above Paris in a hot air balloon By comparison a 21st century flat sounds like a cakewalk We\u2019ve got this A darkroom is like a gas A darkroom is like a gas \u2013 it expands to fill the space available In the 1970s and 80s many darkrooms were built in garages and basements but that\u2019s a luxury which those of us who live in small rented flats can rarely afford But the good news is like a gas a darkroom can also be compressed My enlarger takes up just m\u00b2 on a sideboard and is a nice conversation piece to boot All my other stuff fits into the small cupboard below I just take it out for printing Layout sketch For a photo of the space see below Also like a gas a darkroom expands to fill the budget available largely thanks to that other kind of GAS The budget can also be compressed \u2013 but up to a point and with some compromises Three disclaimers First my \u00a3 figure is my total set up cost for darkroom printing It does include shipping costs but does not include a consumables photographic paper and chemistry b common household items which I already had scissors cardboard empty wine bottles\u2026 and c costs of developing equipment since we\u2019re talking about printing not development My developing equipment cost just \u00a3 all of it new but maybe that\u2019s a story for a future article Second unless you get very lucky a makeshift \u00a3 darkroom won\u2019t be a perfect darkroom If you\u2019re the kind of person who winces at the thought of drying prints with clothes pegs or using a element enlarging lens look away now I\u2019ll be the first to admit that my set up comes with certain inconveniences I\u2019m sure I\u2019d print even more regularly if I could just waltz into a custom built darkroom and get to work rather than having to spend ten minutes before each session light proofing the room taking out trays from storage and so on But then again if printing required a spare garage and several hundred pounds worth of equipment I wouldn\u2019t have started at all Third I am not an expert I\u2019ve been printing for about eighteen months so I\u2019m an enthusiastic novice \u2013 at best But I read a lot practise as much as time allows and try to learn from other printers In fact I\u2019m writing this series not just to share my experience and approach but also because I hope to get feedback from other printers \u2013 beginners as well as experts \u2013 and thus learn some new things TL DR But what if you\u2019re not interested in darkroom printing Skip the rest if you will but I can promise you that the Inspiration section at least will be worth your while We may not all be darkroom enthusiasts but we can all marvel at human ingenuity If printing ever does pique your interest \u2013 on reading Part for example \u2013 the TL DR from this part is that you can most likely set up to print for under \u00a3 in a small flat with no dedicated darkroom space But for that we need to work as far as possible with what we have We have to be creative and source equipment as cheaply as we can We need perhaps to make do without certain things and improvise the rest In short we need to focus on\u2026 The essentials Printing is fundamentally simple An enlarger shines light through a negative projecting an enlarged image onto photo sensitive paper After a controlled exposure that paper is immersed in a sequence of chemicals \u2013 developer stop bath and fixer \u2013 which reveals a positive image My Paterson enlarger Paper and chemistry My set up cost as noted earlier excludes consumables i e photographic paper and chemistry I won\u2019t talk much about paper and chemistry in general mainly because I haven\u2019t tested enough types to form an informed opinion But just for completeness this is what I use Paper Ilford Multigrade Resin Coated Pearl \u00d7 \u2033 and Fomaspeed Variant \u00d7 \u2033 Developer Ilford Multigrade more recently Adox Adotol Konstant but the jury is still out on that one Stop bath Ilford Ilfostop Fixer Adox Adofix Plus I\u2019m happy with these but as I say my experience is limited I chose them mostly because they are popular and easily available Hardware Other than paper chemistry and a few common household items see below this is all you really need to print black and white photographs A dark room which need not be a dedicated space see below An enlarger A timer which can be improvised see below A safelight which can also be improvised see below A graduated vessel Three trays to hold chemicals Tongs to manipulate the paper while processing You also need some form of ventilation in the darkroom even if it\u2019s just opening the door and stepping out for fresh air at regular intervals And you need another tray or basin ideally close to running water to wash the prints \u2013 but this need not be inside the darkroom itself The darkroom The good news is that because photographic paper has relatively low sensitivity a darkroom for printing need not be truly dark A darkroom for film developing is a different story but that\u2019s why changing bags were invented What this means is you don\u2019t necessarily have to invest in blackout curtains paint the walls black or construct an underground bunker deep inside a secret mountain as some sources recommend OK I made the last one up Zero cost light proofing A windowless space like a hallway bathroom or large closet can be light proofed in minutes I\u2019ve also printed in my friend\u2019s room which has a large window hanging a thick bedsheet over the curtain rod and taping the edges to the wall though we were limited to printing at night because the arrangement did not satisfactorily block daylight Other useful light proofing materials include bin bags rugs for light leaks under doors cardboard and newspaper several sheets taped together are surprisingly good at blocking light These are just general principles without knowing your circumstances it\u2019s hard to make more specific light proofing recommendations Just do your best and then\u2026 Do a test When setting up a darkroom I don\u2019t aim for perfect light proofing The key is to make the space as light proof as you can and then test With only the safelight on take out a small piece of photographic paper Put it on the table immediately place a coin on it and leave it for minutes Listen to music meditate or take a nap light from your phone screen will of course ruin the test W Eugene Smith used to watch television covering the screen with a safelight filter But I digress After minutes process the paper as usual but covering each tray to make sure the paper is protected If the room is light proof the piece will be pure white Otherwise the outline of the coin will show up as a white circle against a grey background A failed coin test In that case turn off the safelight and try again If the new test paper is white your safelight is the culprit see below If it\u2019s still grey keep trying until you find the leak It\u2019s better to find out at the start Otherwise you spend time and paper making your first print only to find out your efforts were all in vain I speak from bitter experience Strictly speaking the coin test is not reliable Nevertheless being lazy this is what I use and it works for me If you want to do it by the book the Ilford website has a more rigorous test My darkroom I can\u2019t tell you how exactly to set up because I don\u2019t know your situation What I can do is show you the darkroom I set up in the hallway of my girlfriend\u2019s flat The chemicals paper trays and other accessories live in the cupboard under the enlarger I just take them out for printing The IKEA frames behind the enlarger display some of my prints There is a bathroom just off to the left where I can wash my prints in the basin A few months back I posted this photo to my Facebook darkroom group and other members suggested keeping the trays on newspaper to protect the floor or on an ironing board to raise them to a more convenient height \u2013 both good ideas I went with newspaper I quite like agitating the trays as I sit on the floor like a prospector panning for gold Someone else commented \u201cWhere there is a hall there is a way \u201d which is now my official hallway darkroom motto The enlarger At this point in the proceedings it is customary to take a deep dive into the merits of condenser versus diffusion enlargers uncovered versus glass negative carriers and other such minutiae I won\u2019t First off these have been discussed to death in innumerable books and forum threads whereas our focus here is to get up and running printing as simply and inexpensively as possible not spend hours wrestling with the paradox of choice However if you do want to research enlargers James Ollinger\u2019s Beginner\u2019s Guide to Enlargers is a good place to start Second choice is often illusory In the January issue of Popular Photography David Vestal did a painstaking scientific comparison of condenser and diffusion enlargers \u2013 a polarising if not inflammatory issue among darkroom printers yes we need to get out more Vestal\u2019s conclusion The prints looked so much alike that neither I nor Popular Photography \u2019s editors could tell by looking at them which print came from which enlarger head We had to look up my notes to find out My advice unless you\u2019re printing professionally in which case why are you reading about \u00a3 darkrooms is to get a cheap working enlarger Or even a scrap enlarger if you think you can get it working again they are simple machines Sell it and upgrade later if you want to and when you have a better sense of what you want Well Get a cheap enlarger but not just any enlarger There are two main considerations Negative size First the enlarger must suit the negative size you want to print I print 35mm so I got one with a 35mm negative carrier and a 50mm lens rule of thumb the lens should have a focal length longer than the diagonal of the film My enlarger came with a basic Paterson 50mm f3 lens I\u2019ve also printed with my friend\u2019s Leitz Focotar 40mm f2 and seen prints made by a professional printer with an El Nikkor 50mm f2 These are both very highly regarded lenses and almost certainly better than my Paterson but I haven\u2019t done a direct comparison I\u2019m happy with the Paterson for now but I may upgrade someday if I\u2019m convinced that it will produce an obvious improvement in \u00d7 \u2033 prints by \u2018obvious\u2019 I mean \u2018obvious to a normal person\u2019 not \u2018obvious if you scrutinise corner sharpness with a 5x loupe\u2019 Filters Second I recommend some form of filtration I go into this in more detail in Part but by using filters in combination with variable contrast paper you can print at different contrast grades on the same type of paper The alternative is to buy a different pack of paper for each contrast grade\u2026 or relinquish contrast control altogether Mine is a colour enlarger It has colour filters technically a \u2018dichroic filter head\u2019 which conveniently can also be used for contrast control in black and white printing Yellow filters reduce contrast and magenta filters increase it My enlarger also has a highly convenient red filter which lets you view the projected image on the paper without exposing the paper which is insensitive to red light This makes it a cinch to position the paper accurately Some black and white enlargers have multigrade filters for variable contrast If not a basic set of Ilford multigrade filters can be bought new for less than \u00a3 \u2013 but check first for compatibility with your enlarger Sourcing equipment When I decided to try darkroom printing I did some research and ultimately got myself a Paterson Colour Darkroom kit off eBay It cost \u00a3 including postage and came in its original albeit slightly weathered box It was missing a few of the original items but it did have an enlarger the most crucial component graduated vessel trays and tongs The only essentials it didn\u2019t include are the timer and safelight more on that below My darkroom kit from eBay Original advert from from photomemorabilia co uk used by kind permission of the author The website says the kits sold new for around \u00a3 over \u00a3 in today\u2019s money I see these Paterson kits come up about once a month on eBay UK and they sell for around the same price as I paid for mine So I\u2019d say I got a decent deal but not a once in a lifetime deal\u2026 which means you can too The Paterson is an entry level kit from the early 1980s targeted at the amateur market I\u2019ve also used my friend\u2019s top of the line Leitz Focomat V35 which is superior in every way Using my friend Saha\u2019s Leitz Focomat Still the Paterson works for me \u2013 and costs a fraction of the Leitz Most other brands Durst Beseler Omega Meopta\u2026 are equally good if not better Gumtree Facebook marketplace workplace message boards flea markets thrift stores and older relatives\u2019 attics are all good hunting grounds of course the usual used equipment buying warnings apply I\u2019ve also heard many stories of people getting enlargers for free from retired photographers or sadly college darkrooms being closed down If you come across a good deal on an enlarger but are unsure if it fits your needs just Google it or post a question on one of the many darkroom related online forums or Facebook groups And if your enlarger doesn\u2019t come with trays tongs etc those are available on eBay too at very reasonable prices Improvising the rest As I said my Paterson kit did not include two items which are in my \u2018essentials\u2019 list see above namely a timer and a safelight Timer Dedicated darkroom timers can be connected to the enlarger You pre set the time you want to expose for and the enlarger switches off automatically You can buy a used timer or even make one which I might try someday Or if you\u2019re lucky your enlarger may already come with a timer Mine didn\u2019t Instead I just use an ordinary analogue clock with a second hand My enlarging times are seldom longer than seconds so I mentally count the seconds as I enlarge Listening for the ticks is easier than watching the second hand especially if I\u2019m making test strips see Part or dodging burning see Part If you don\u2019t have a ticking clock you can even use a simple metronome app on your phone \u2013 just keep the screen facing down Initially counting seconds seemed a bit daunting on top of everything else but I found it soon became second nature though I am bad at multi tasking in general It may not be as precise as using a dedicated timer but the difference between say seconds and seconds is stops which is imperceptible to the naked eye Besides I recently learned that counting seconds is what Ansel Adams used to do \u2013 and what\u2019s good enough for him is good enough for me Safelight Black and white photo papers are insensitive to amber and red light but not all safelights are \u2018safe\u2019 Faulty safelights may leak yellow or white light which fog the paper On the other hand many light sources are effective safelights although they are not marketed as such Luckily safeness is easy to test using the \u2018coin test\u2019 described above You can use any amber or red light so long as you test it this way My first safelight was a phone flashlight covered by the red filter from a pair of 3D glasses propped up on a shelf Safelight v1 When I posted this photo to my Facebook darkroom group it generated a good deal of amusement Some kind people even offered to send me a spare safelight for free I had to explain that I was not in dire need I just wanted to see what I could get away with The phone light was however quite dim A safelight need not shine with the power of a thousand suns but it does need to be bright enough to let me read and write notes see Part So next I switched to red LED bicycle lights With time I got tired of having to go down and take lights off my bike every time I wanted to print and finally I bought a 15W red bulb for \u00a3 bringing the total to \u00a3 When I want to print I simply swap out the regular lightbulb for my red bulb Safelight v3 Nice to haves The list of nice to haves is longer than the list of essentials \u2013 as in the darkroom so also in life I\u2019ve limited myself to three but there\u2019s all kinds of other stuff you could buy Some like squeegees and compressed air blowers are cheap Others like drying cabinets and densitometers can be quite expensive Easel My enlarger came with a baseboard but not an easel For a couple of weeks I was printing on paper placed directly on the baseboard covering the margins with rulers or books to make borders but then I tired of it A proper easel lets you position paper more accurately and securely and the easel blades help a lot with borders I\u2019d say this is a nice to have bordering on an essential I got my easel on eBay for \u00a3 including shipping bringing the total to \u00a3 Grain focuser My Paterson kit came with a grain focuser It helps with precise focusing but I don\u2019t consider it essential if you have good near vision Contact sheet printer A few months after I set up my darkroom I sold my first print a long exposure of Victorian era gasworks in Greenwich London I had priced the print at only \u00a3 but I thought I should use the proceeds to buy myself a darkroom indulgence I finally settled on a contact sheet printer from eBay which was exactly \u00a3 including shipping bringing the total to \u00a3 A contact sheet is a sequence of negatives printed directly on a sheet of paper in fact one of my favourite photography books is a compilation of Magnum contact sheets The negatives are not enlarged but placed directly on \u2013 in \u2018contact\u2019 with \u2013 the paper itself Contact sheets let you see a whole roll at a glance and identify the keepers Since the whole roll is printed at the same enlarger setting it also shows the exposure and contrast of individual photos which informs how we might print it In practice I usually look at digital scans to decide which ones to print but I sometimes print contact sheets anyway because I think they look extremely cool Part of a contact sheet from a roll shot at a climate change march in Copenhagen I used to print contact sheets using just a clear piece of glass to hold the negatives flat against the paper but a contact sheet printer is more convenient and a nice memento of my first print sale Miscellaneous Modifications My enlarger column unfortunately has a small crack at its base so it doesn\u2019t stand rigid the weight of the enlarger head gives it a slight forward tilt This is not good If the negative and lens planes are not parallel to the easel the print will not be sharp all over and may even be distorted This effect can be exploited for creative purposes as Nigel Henderson did with his Stressed Photographs but is clearly not ideal for regular printing I fix this by the low tech but effective means of tying the enlarger column to a bookshelf behind it the tension keeps it level As with light proofing see above my approach is to do a quick and dirty fix with rope in this case and then test To check that your enlarger is correctly aligned \u2013 which I recommend even if you don\u2019t have an obvious issue like mine \u2013 there\u2019s the time honoured negative scratch method For a quick check you can even use a bubble level phone app A smaller modification was to tape a card to the enlarger head as a reminder of the filter settings for various contrast grades I got this idea from Way Beyond Monochrome by Lambrecht and Woodhouse Manufacturers of variable contrast paper like Ilford publish tables with such information but it helps to have a ready reference while printing Household items Everything else I need I had at home \u2013 and you probably do too Wine bottles to store chemicals a plastic spoon for a stirring rod dodging and burning tools made from cardboard and wire see Part clothes pegs for drying prints basic stationery like ruler scissors marker pens and so on As I said I haven\u2019t counted these costs in my total Less more In summary my total set up cost including shipping was \u00a3 Paterson kit including enlarger graduated vessel trays and tongs \u00a3 red bulb \u00a3 easel \u00a3 contact sheet printer Total \u00a3 Perhaps even more importantly I didn\u2019t need a dedicated darkroom space \u2013 just an easily light proofable hallway and a sideboard But what if you do have space or if you\u2019re not on a shoestring budget Well congratulations on getting this far but you\u2019ve been reading the wrong article Fritz Nordengren over on Emulsive talks about how to set up a darkroom for under note that he had a dedicated darkroom space already Elsewhere on this site Dan Castelli describes how he renovated and outfitted his enviably well equipped darkroom Or perhaps you could set up a low cost darkroom anyway and spend the spare cash on more paper and chemistry I don\u2019t mean to suggest there\u2019s something morally superior about a low cost darkroom \u2013 far from it If I had the space I\u2019d build a dedicated darkroom If I won the lottery I\u2019d buy more and better equipment But building a darkroom on a small budget is not just about saving money Along the way it taught me the value of trying to get the best possible results with minimal gear creative problem solving and to some extent accepting perhaps even embracing small inconveniences and imperfections Inspiration But a lot of photographers recoil from inconveniences and imperfections and most of us love buying gear Perhaps for that reason many books and websites make darkroom set up seem more elaborate and expensive than it needs to be In this article I\u2019ve tried to counter this with the example of my functional but cheap darkroom and reflections on my general approach Of course that is not to encourage others to replicate my set up It\u2019s more about an attitude \u2013 or a philosophy if you will being frugal flexible and resourceful but without compromising the quality of the final print The idea is to start with that approach and adapt it to your unique circumstances So in addition to my darkroom I thought it would be fun to reach out to other people who share the same philosophy and take a glimpse into their darkrooms To that end I posted on my Facebook darkroom group asking for examples of creative use of space The thread garnered comments including some real gems I present four examples below with the contributors\u2019 permission of course Hunter\u2019s darkroom Hunter Menzel from Wyoming sets up his enlarger in his bathtub on a folding table from Costco He says the hardest part is bringing everything upstairs from the basement \u201cBut once it\u2019s all in place I can develop and print all day \u201d Hunter got his whole darkroom from a teacher who was retiring He had to drive across two states to get it but it was all free Natalie\u2019s darkroom Natalie from Pennsylvania has converted a corner of her basement into a darkroom using a wooden frame covered with black plastic tarp Patrick\u2019s darkroom Patrick Rapps from Arizona has his enlarger on a cart with shelves for trays and a timer He keeps his cart in the garage \u201cFor printing I just roll it up next to washer and dryer set trays on them and go to work \u201d he explains \u2013 like it\u2019s the most natural thing in the world Finally Josh O\u2019Sullivan from Lincoln posted a photo of the University of Sheffield PhotoSoc\u2019s darkroom a great reminder that if you\u2019re lucky enough to have access to a community darkroom that can be as good as having your own \u2013 or perhaps even better I\u2019m grateful to everyone who commented on the thread and shared photos I found them oddly inspiring \u2013 a real highlight of writing this piece I hope you liked them too Next up Part That\u2019s all for now \u2013 see you in Part If there\u2019s anything specific you\u2019d like me to cover let me know in the comments and I\u2019ll see what I can do And if you have any low cost darkroom tips tricks and experiences to share

dachas have become a welcome refuge It s the great outdoors we can walk in nature without wearing a mask says Arina Bannikova a year old architect who is at her dacha in Sokolniki a small settlement an hour s drive northwest from Moscow with her mother sister another family of four a dog and two cats Barrelling past on his scooter year old Maxime couldn t be happier Here I ve got all the space I want he shouts Nearly half of Russia s population is estimated to have a dacha so when authorities began imposing lockdown measures on Moscow last month thousands streamed out of the city Online searches for dacha rentals also soared with nearly five times as many requests as usual in the first two weeks of April according to figures from real estate portal Cian ru A comeback for countryside It s interesting because these last years were marked by a serious crisis for the dacha says Mikhail Alekseevsky a Russian anthropologist who has made a study of the country homes A lot of people are suddenly remembering that they have a dacha and starting urgent repairs with the priority the installation of a good internet connection Dachas had been hugely popular in Soviet times and after the collapse of the USSR when many used their vegetable patches to make up for food shortages But as Russia s economy grew in the 2000s and early 2010s many abandoned their countryside getaways to spend weekends at new restaurants and cinemas in the city or to travel abroad Notorious weekend traffic jams to dacha country didn t help The proportion of Russians with a dacha has been falling with pollster VTsIOM saying it dropped from in to last year In the USSR the dacha was a way to escape Soviet reality But in a globalised world there are sometimes more interesting things to do than work in a vegetable patch Alekseevsky says With the coronavirus the other entertainment options are no longer available And dacha residents say being in the countryside makes it easier to follow isolation rules I can t say we are completely sheltered from the virus But I feel safe here says Nataliya Sapiga a year old school teacher at her dacha in Sokolniki There are fewer people here so we can follow all the recommended safety rules Alekseevsky says Russians have a deep affinity for their dachas and that having a patch of land and a vegetable garden has a very strong significance in the country And with this epidemic the idea of having a dacha in good condition will gain strength he predicts Like we say here it s always better to have an emergency landing strip", "page_url":

addition starting with those who arrived March at Joint Base San Antonio Lackland in Texas enlisted basic trainees are under restricted movement in their first days and have no contact with trainees who started training after that day period he noted No new recruits reported to basic military training last week he said and that will continue until the Air Force has had time to implement new procedures to protect against COVID This period of time was also needed to sanitize dormitories dining facilities and other spaces he added The Air Force has implemented medical screening at both initial entry and at the end of the two week period of restricted movement Webb told reporters Basic training has been shortened from eight and a half weeks to seven weeks to maximize training effectiveness and space utilization the general said achieved by spending less time on drill and ceremony training and streamlining the process of issuing uniforms Basic training is also being conducted at Keesler Air Force Base Mississippi starting this week to help in increasing social distancing at Joint Base San Antonio Lackland which had been the Air Force s sole basic training venue he said After basic training airmen receive technical training in one of their military occupational specialties at locations across the United States and a few overseas locations Commanders at these technical training sites have been directed to similarly modify their courses to reduce the risk of COVID Webb said Modifications include splitting training into shifts to reduce class sizes using distance learning more often and moving classrooms outdoors he noted Training that can only be done in close quarters or large groups has been deferred Officer Training School at Maxwell Gunter Air Force Base Alabama has adopted the same procedures as enlisted basic training the general said Meanwhile he added ROTC cadets are completing their training through distance learning and recruiters are using innovative social media techniques to communicate with prospective airmen The Air Force may retain aspects of distance learning and social distancing necessitated by the pandemic in its training

bouncing hydraulics a lowrider isn\u2019t just something you own it\u2019s something you are Estevan Oriol and Mister Cartoon n\u00e9e Mark Machado are born and bred Angelenos \u2013 Oriol from West LA and Cartoon from San Pedro They lived similar yet separate lives until when their paths collided and their ascension to hip hop eminence began explored in detail in the new Netflix documentary LA Originals \u201cThe world\u2019s kind of small in lowrider culture \u201d says Cartoon who was given his nickname in high school because of his animated personality \u201cI didn\u2019t know what networking was but that\u2019s what I was doing when I met Estevan at a record release party I had done the cover art for When I found out he was a lowrider too we instantly connected \u201d Growing up in south Los Angeles Cartoon seamlessly transitioned between various creative endeavors Discovering a preternatural skill for drawing at a young age his parents \u2013 who owned a lithograph printing company \u2013 wholeheartedly supported his craft emboldening him to pursue a career in art What began with pen on paper soon evolved to spray paint on walls airbrush on T shirts and prints on paper before finally arriving at ink on skin In addition to designing the logos for Cypress Hill and Eminem\u2019s Shady Records Cartoon has etched the hides of pop culture royalty such as B Real Kobe Bryant Eminem Cent Travis Barker Justin Timberlake Beyonc\u00e9 Danny Trejo and Snoop Dogg some of whom are featured in the film His style became iconic because he was one of the first artists to diverge from the ever popular flash style of tattoo wherein a numbered series of traditional designs hung on the wall that patrons picked on the spot Cartoon\u2019s tattoos were \u2013 and still are \u2013 custom seminal and distinct Fusing his Mexican heritage lowrider aesthetics and hip hop culture with the fine line style of tattoo art that was born in California prisons he quickly found a niche \u201cThe tattoo world is different from any other art form \u201d says Cartoon \u201cIn every other style of art especially graffiti if you take somebody\u2019s shit you\u2019re a biter you stole it With tattooing you can borrow anybody\u2019s artwork and put it on as a tattoo because you don\u2019t sign them \u2013 it\u2019s all borrowed inspired by other cultures and artists and combined with the tattoo artist\u2019s own style \u201d Though Cartoon\u2019s most well known canvas is skin one can also marvel at his latest mural painted on the exterior of the Chicano landmark Casa Vega a family owned historic Mexican restaurant located in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles Open since Casa Vega is a local institution that has seen patrons such as Marlon Brando and Quentin Tarantino in its glossy tufted red booths Meanwhile in West LA Oriol was living a parallel existence The son of renowned activist artist and photographer Eriberto Oriol he was genetically predisposed to living the life of a creative Though lowrider culture was his passion he found work as a bouncer for a hip hop club It was there he became a friend to a clique of hip hop pioneers which eventually led him to becoming a tour manager for Cypress Hill and House of Pain Nearing the eve of his launch into the rap touring world his father gave him a gift that unbeknown to Estevan at the time would reroute the trajectory of his life A still from LA Originals Photograph Netflix \u201cThe first camera I got was a Minolta 35mm \u201d Oriol who also directed the documentary reflects \u201cIt was given to me by my dad and was his spare camera He was also a photographer but was kind of over photography by that time He said \u2018Hey man I got this extra camera You\u2019re doing your lowriding stuff and going on tour with House of Pain so you should take pictures of all that \u2019\u201d \u201cI started out real slow taking pictures of my people in the lowrider community then also of House of Pain \u201d Oriol continues \u201cAt first I felt really uncomfortable bringing out a camera and putting it in people\u2019s faces but after a while I started getting used to it and it became easier I was the only person taking photos on these tours at the time \u201d What began as capturing moments for posterity became a full blown career Since touring with House of Pain and Cypress Hill nearly years ago Oriol has become a photography heavyweight his work often showcasing the gritty microcosms of LA that are diametrically opposed to the Hollywood glamour often projected to the world at large Additionally he has directed several music videos making him as much a fixture of the hip hop community as the rappers themselves Oriol\u2019s photography portfolio boasts an impressive lineup of athletes artists celebrities and musicians alongside his unpolished often black and white captures of Skid Row\u2019s homeless community as well as Latinx gang and tattoo cultures He has photographed rap deities such as Dr Dre Cypress Hill Ice Cube Bone Thugs N Harmony Big Pun Rick Rubin and the Beastie Boys as well as the portraits of Al Pacino Dennis Hopper Robert De Niro and

Los Angeles Magazine in an article about the famed image It has since been copied mass produced and turned into clip art in several forms \u2013 from T shirts to coffee mugs In Oriol sued clothing retailers H M and Brandy Melville which used the image without his permission According to Oriol the judge ruled that a hand gesture cannot be trademarked by comparing it to the peace sign Another finger gesture comes to mind but the peace sign is the more diplomatic choice for comparison despite the unfortunate ruling of the case When Oriol and Cartoon finally merged their creative psyches a super duo was formed Though both were successful apart together they created an empire After Oriol made Cartoon his first tattoo gun out of a Walkman motor and a Bic pen taught to him by a friend who made one in prison Cartoon\u2019s career flourished They went on world tours with hip hop giants photographing and tattooing them along the way They established a creative agency called Soul Assassins that was unfortunately shuttered shortly after the market crash in They partied they hustled they traveled they created they never stopped lowriding and now they\u2019ve made a documentary about it all One of the most important tenets of their ethos however which is scarcely publicized is their community outreach \u201cWe are always helping out the community we just don\u2019t publicize it \u201d Oriol explains \u201cWe\u2019re not doing it for a pat on the back we\u2019re doing it more because I have family members who have been homeless and friends and family members that were drug addicts I donate my time I donate clothes I donate money I donate food to homeless people and mentally ill people And now also we give jobs to convicted felons who can\u2019t find work \u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing outreach in schools for years also \u201d Cartoon adds \u201cWe didn\u2019t show that in the movie \u2018cause it\u2019s just what we do We don\u2019t film it too often you

conjures a \u201cback to the future\u201d feeling For decades during the Cold War major overseas training exercises featured prominently in the U S military\u2019s playbook and with good reason Big exercises \u2014 training thousands of troops across services domains and sometimes nations \u2014 enhance joint force readiness by improving interoperability and building command control and communications among services and coalition members demonstrate the value of relationships with allies and partners and send a range of messages to adversaries To update the joint force for the challenge of China and Russia the United States should build on these Cold War lessons by ensuring that its large scale joint exercises also test U S forces\u2019 ability to operate in multiple domains against \u201cgray zone\u201d threats Pretend Jointness Regaining the muscle memory to compete against China and Russia after counter insurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan is no small task The pivot from counter insurgency to great power competition is moving slowly \u2014 for two reasons First there is widespread confusion as to what accurately constitutes a joint experiment or exercise To be clear a joint exercise entails significant personnel participation from each of the services that are integrated into a single joint force executing the will of the joint force commander It is not a Navy corpsman going to the field with the Marine infantry unit it is not an Air Force Joint Tactical Air Control Party supporting an Army rotation at the National Training Center and it is not Marine Corps fixed wing aviation deploying aboard aircraft carriers No these are joint operations with a \u201clittle j\u201d \u2014 activities that the services routinely conducted a half century ago Today these \u201clittle j\u201d events overly focused on service sustainment training do little to advance 21st century concept experimentation and joint force integration in preparation for major conflict Jointness with a \u201cbig J \u201d on the other hand is a deployable joint headquarters that is fully integrated with experts from across all the warfighting functions and services The headquarters should be commanded by a flag officer and tasked by a combatant commander with cradle to grave execution of large scale exercises that agnostically integrate kinetic and non kinetic effects across the air land sea cyber and space domains as well as the electronic spectrum Although talk of jointness abounds across the Department of Defense the force seldom walks the \u201cbig J\u201d walk To quote Winston Churchill \u201cperhaps we have been guilty of some terminological inexactitude \u201d A second factor is that planners across the combatant commands are consumed with repeating the same named annual exercises even though most of them \u2014 to be precise \u2014 are demonstrations or service centric sustainment training These exercises drain scarce resources and compound legitimate challenges to expanding jointness\u2013 to include tracking and coordinating service specific concept development sustaining a reasonable operations tempo complying with headquarters mandated reductions and reducing overhead costs Decreasing the number of annual combatant command events to accommodate a joint force commander\u2019s higher quality experimentation plan and credible \u201cbig J\u201d exercises is therefore an imperative that can no longer be ignored Victory on tomorrow\u2019s battlefield against peer adversaries requires that the United States transform how it prepares for war The Past as Prologue \u201cKinda\u201d Large scale Cold War exercises ensured that combat formations remained tactically proficient and officers gave serious thought to the likely chaos and uncertainty that major conflict between nuclear powers would create But these exercises also played a critical political military role signaling a strong U S commitment to allies and partners whose forces routinely operated with the United States in combined maneuvers designed in part to help improve coalition interoperability and bolster readiness Such exercises did not only serve as a signal to allies and partners though Their value as a showcase for U S resolve and global power projection capabilities was significant Large exercises like REFORGER Return of Forces to Germany and TEAM SPIRIT in South Korea were essential to maintaining credible conventional deterrence of both the Soviet Union and North Korea As intended the latter two belligerent states often perceived such exercises as war plan rehearsals and as possible but still ambiguous forward posturing for potential operations Large multiple theater exercises diminished after the Cold War The Pentagon focused on reducing operating costs confronting terrorism and fighting simultaneous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan But the rise of China and renewed focus on Russia means large scale overseas exercises should again play a key role in sustaining readiness and demonstrating U S preparedness to deploy and conduct multi domain operations But the complexity of today\u2019s security environment is not defined solely by conventional peer versus peer or even proxy conflicts China and Russia rely on gray zone operations below the traditional thresholds for conflict \u2014 competing with the United States without provoking a conventional response Future joint and combined exercises should go beyond the traditional air land and sea domains to include cyberwarfare space the electromagnetic spectrum \u2014 all integrated into a holistic and coherent operational design that includes features of irregular warfare Jointly considering and exercising responses to gray zone threats will pay dividends across the force Soviet Exercises during the Cold War The Soviet Union attracted U S attention by using large scale exercises as operational rehearsals and as signaling tools The Okean global naval exercise series in the 1970s demonstrated the transformation of the Soviets\u2019 coastal defensive navy to a blue water force under Adm Sergey Gorshkov In April multi fleet maneuvers across many oceans under a unified command from Moscow shocked the U S Navy and its NATO allies who identified them as a challenge to U S maritime supremacy In April Soviet news agency TASS reported an even larger naval exercise \u2014 Okean the largest to date in the Cold War \u2014 involving over Soviet ships of all types conducting maritime maneuvers by the Northern Baltic Black Sea and Pacific fleets Land based aircraft joined this massive power projection display with Tupolov 35s flying from Central Asian bases to the Arabian Sea while surface units in the Indian Ocean indicated Soviet anti convoy capabilities in a new theater Meanwhile maritime task forces conducting antiaircraft carrier operations near Sardinia highlighted a potential Soviet threat to western merchant shipping and NATO naval activities at Tyrrhenian Sea choke points In a particularly pointed signal submarines and surface ships set up a barrier between Iceland the Norwegian Sea and the North Atlantic to rehearse extending the Soviet maritime defensive perimeter away from the Barents Sea to keep U S aircraft carriers out of range of military and industrial targets Significant command and control capabilities enabled simultaneous Soviet strike missions highlighting the maturation of Gorshkov\u2019s long discussed \u201cbattle of the first salvo\u201d concept The massive scale of Okean was impressive for the times and elicited a sharp reaction from the United States Navy Secretary J William Middendorf II publicly admitted \u201c the exercise clearly demonstrates the fact that the Soviet navy is capable of operating effectively in all the oceans of the world\u201d with a fleet that had \u201ctwice the number of major combatants and submarines as the U S Navy \u201d Okean was a wake up call for the United States which was preoccupied with evacuating Vietnam Rattled Pentagon leaders commissioned a series of studies to better understand the new geopolitical landscape that was shaping the Cold War The unambiguous message sent by the Okean exercises of the 1970s was that the Soviet Union had developed a robust navy to back its claim as a global military superpower Learning from the \u201cBear\u201d During the 1980s Pentagon planners recognized that large exercises could play a useful role in demonstrating U S power projection capabilities while offsetting the Soviet Union conventional military advantages Accordingly the United States implemented annual REFORGER exercises to practice rapidly deploying multiple divisions from the United States to reinforce NATO As one observer noted REFORGER\u2019s impressiveness stemmed not only from its size personnel deployed across the Atlantic in days but also its critically important military and civilian mobilization and preparedness when U S forces reached Europe REFORGER exercises were also complemented with annual air and sea deployments of U S Marines to Norway Collectively they broadcasted to friends and adversaries alike America\u2019s ability to rapidly project credible combat power across the globe Other U S and NATO naval exercises in the 1980s were designed to prod Soviet decision makers and expose Soviet wartime responses for U S planners Virtually the entire U S attack submarine force was deployed at top speed from U S ports to the high North Atlantic on at least three separate occasions sending the message to the Soviets among others that the United States could reach the Barents Sea before Soviet subs could sortie out of their bastions In the Atlantic Ocean Venture encompassed personnel aircraft and ships from allied nations The apparently shocked Soviet navy dispatched \u201cunprecedented numbers\u201d of surveillance and strike aircraft submarines and surface ships to shadow the exercise offering the United States and NATO valuable insights into Soviet formations and operational procedures Not all signals sent during Cold War exercises were received as intended The NATO ABLE ARCHER exercise contributed to a Kremlin war scare and nearly initiated nuclear war Nonetheless NATO judged the exercises\u2019 strategic insights as invaluable Then Supreme Allied Commander Gen John R Galvin observed \u201cThere was a failure to understand the absolute requirement for coordination and common purpose among the civilian political diplomatic governmental and military aspects of every endeavor \u201d On the other side of the globe U S and South Korean forces conducted exercise TEAM SPIRIT each spring from to to broadcast credible defensive preparations of the peninsula to North Korea TEAM SPIRIT peaked at personnel in but its importance lay in its impact on North Korean perceptions President Kim Il sung reacted to the exercise by mobilizing his reservists and repositioning air naval and land forces annually at significant economic and political costs to the regime making TEAM SPIRIT both a carrot and a stick for Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty negotiations and North Korea\u2019s inspections compliance By revealing certain strengths through REFORGER and TEAM SPIRIT U S planners enhanced deterrence and forced adversaries to divert resources into more expensive defense programs or alter key aspects of their overall strategies Operate and Train as You Plan to Fight Treating peacetime exercises as real world operations \u2014 like the United States did with REFORGER and TEAM SPIRIT \u2014 provides the joint force with a number of advantages Across the force a heightened warfighting mentality will help improve overall readiness Such an approach will imbue training events with a heightened sense of realism compelling forces to replicate many actions they will have to execute in conflict Imagine a scenario where Army and Marine High Mobility Artillery Rocket System HIMARS units deploy with little notice to remote overseas islands and establish secure communications with a joint task force headquarters theater fires cell The cell then receives targetable information from real world sensors provided by space or training drones This allows the HIMARS unit to engage a hostile moving target being simulated by a self piloted \u201cgarbage barge\u201d once non kinetic effects have neutralized onboard emitters replicating the ship\u2019s countermeasure system This \u201ccradle to grave\u201d kill chain scenario requires sophisticated multi domain effects to be integrated across the joint force If for technical or political reasons this type of realism is impractical augmenting live exercises with high quality virtual capabilities can help servicemembers master essential skills This is especially important at the joint combined level because those senior headquarters that are not forward deployed should be required to deploy to overseas exercise locations to flex their command and control responsibilities Second dynamically planned operations can be used to temporarily increase U S force posture and presence overseas Deploying additional brigades air defense units and fleet assets to key European and Pacific theater locations will not go unnoticed by Beijing Moscow and Pyongyang More importantly these events can serve as pre crisis flexible deterrent options Before the outbreak of COVID the exercise DEFENDER Europe would have been the largest deployment of U S based forces to Europe in more than years Carrying out similar future exercises will also allow the United States and its NATO allies to address long standing interoperability mobility and command and control challenges Third operations can be used to stress test existing practices against new concepts In particular the logistical concepts that underpin major war plans can be tested by requiring forward deployed units to actually perform such real world sustainment functions as drawing live ammunition out of storage bunkers transporting different fuel types between theaters and commencing operations with \u201cplanned shortages\u201d of major classes of supplies These critical sustainment events are too often ignored or \u201csimulated\u201d in traditional exercises which allows the joint force to \u201ccheat at solitaire\u201d \u2014 in other words to take expedient shortcuts New exercises can also stress test familiar operations at unfamiliar scales One such exercise might test special operations and conventional forces\u2019 ability to enforce a blockade with the simultaneous boarding of multiple adversary leased commercial vessels Simultaneous ship seizures by special operations forces and conventional Navy Marine units trained to conduct complex \u201cvisit board search and seizure\u201d missions would signal mastery of all domain coordination Moreover it would afford at tightly integrated rehearsal with multiple coalition partners who could provide the leased ships safe anchorage until the mock naval blockade ends Fourth new large scale exercises will allow the joint combined force to experiment with concepts that are widely discussed in many military journals such as multi domain or all domain operations but that are too infrequently practiced As Andrew F Krepinevich Jr has noted properly designed and conducted field exercises are a \u201cgreat source of competitive advantage\u201d that can reduce uncertainty about emerging threats determine the right mix of new and legacy systems enable development and evaluation of broad capabilities and new relevant forms of operation and uncover practical problems in new operation and force structure development Fifth large training exercises can be effective vehicles for sending signals to potential adversaries about U S intentions and capabilities For example they might reveal the capability of U S forces to launch surprise drone swarm attacks simultaneously against multiple naval targets U S vessels could be designated a naval opposing force being pursued by \u201cblue\u201d surface and subsurface naval assets Opposing force ships could then come under swarm drone attack from shore based land forces American or allied that release waves of inexpensive sea skimming short range drones Obviously the risks and opportunities associated with revealing certain capabilities and sending specific messages should be calculated in advance The United States should carefully consider any ambiguities that U S adversaries could misunderstand thus resulting in spiraling tensions and unwanted escalation Tracking and recording both adversary and ally responses to exercises should be required and post exercise analyses should gauge the overall impact of messaging Looking Ahead The joint staff and geographic combatant commander\u2019s need to revise their annual experimentation and exercise programs to be more relevant to today\u2019s great power competition They cannot merely fall back on large scale exercises like REFORGER and TEAM SPIRIT designed for another era in the hope that they continue to be successful models for today\u2019s deterrence and force posture Exercises of yesteryear should be refined and repurposed as real world operations They should thoughtfully reveal credible kinetic and carefully selected non kinetic warfighting capabilities to U S adversaries Additionally a sophisticated global strategic communications campaign that pushes back on adversary propaganda and disinformation in real time \u2014 delegitimizing such activities in frontline states under a bright international spotlight \u2014 should be central to all operations To truly disincentivize Russian and Chinese \u201cgray zone\u201d operations the United States should effectively use recurring and realistic \u201cbig J\u201d operations to display credible American military force A critical by product of this approach is that joint force commanders will be able to integrate and shape the disparate service warfighting approaches Tom Greenwood USMC Ret is a

get fat Hogs get slaughtered So how come no one has taken the Space Launch System rocket behind the woodshed yet We ll answer that question in a moment First some news on Friday the space agency announced that it had awarded a contract to Aerojet Rocketdyne to build additional space shuttle main engines for the Space Launch System rocket The contract is valued at billion\u2014so million per engine However this is not the true price of these engines NASA has previously given more than billion to Aerojet to restart production of the space shuttle era engines and a contract for six new ones So according to the space agency NASA has spent billion for a total of rocket engines That comes to million per engine Or bars of Gold Pressed Latinum as this is a deal only the Ferengi could love The NASA news release says that Aerojet has implemented a plan to reduce the cost of the engines by as much as percent noting the use of more advanced manufacturing techniques These savings however are difficult to square with reality It is true that the shuttle main engine or RS is the Ferrari of rocket engines NASA designed these brilliant engines in the 1970s for the space shuttle program during which they each flew multiple launches A total of engines were built for the shuttle at an estimated cost of million per engine But now these formerly reusable engines will be flown a single time on the SLS rocket and then dropped into the ocean There are four engines on a Space Launch System rocket At this price the engines for an SLS rocket alone will cost more than million This does not include the costs of fabricating the rocket s large core stage towering solid rocket boosters an upper stage or the costs of test transportation storage and integration With engine prices like these it seems reasonable to assume that the cost of a single SLS launch will remain billion in perpetuity Just to summarize that for you NASA is spending at least three times more for an engine that was previously built for reuse but now is expendable And in the news release Aerojet brags about reducing the price of these engines There are a lot of things one could buy in the aerospace industry for million One might for example buy at least six RD engines from Russia These engines have more than twice the thrust of a space shuttle main engine Or one might go to United Launch Alliance s Rocket Builder website and purchase two basic Atlas V rocket launches You could buy three flight proven Falcon launches One might even buy a Falcon Heavy launch which has two thirds the lift capacity of the Space Launch System at one twentieth the price and you d still have enough money left over to buy several hundred actual Ferrari sports cars Or again you could buy a single expendable rocket engine Speaking of engines SpaceX is building the Raptor rocket engine to power its Super Heavy rocket and Starship upper stage The Raptor has slightly more power at sea level than the RS and is designed for dozens of uses According to SpaceX founder Elon Musk it costs less than million to build a Raptor engine The company has already built a couple dozen of them on its own dime So there s that Anyway the original question concerned why the SLS rocket has not been canceled You didn t need to read this article to find the answer\u2014it s right there on NASA s website Men and women in all states are

Special Instruments Training course instructors have begun using their skills to 3D print prototypes to supply the medical facilities in the area with N95 face masks and face shields A neurosurgeon in Billings Montana worked with a dental company to create reusable plastic N95 masks using 3D printers In an effort to help protect those caring for sick individuals around the world he made a model available online for a free 3D printable high efficiency filtration mask with a design that allows reuse of the mask several times due to the replaceable filtration device U S Air Force Tech Sgt Donald Kramer 312th Training Squadron Special Instruments Training course instructor supervisor cuts the clear plastic shield for the 3D printed face shields at the Louis F Garland Department of Defense Fire Academy on Goodfellow Air Force Base Texas March Many SPINSTRA instructors have personal D printers home providing more resources to the project U S Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Robyn Hunsinger Instructors got the idea from Air Force Quarantine University a public Facebook group for innovative learners to connect during the COVID crisis where they saw other organizations modeling and printing these supplies \u201cWe saw other people 3D printing medical supplies and we thought we should try printing things like face masks and face shields \u201d said Master Sgt Manuel Campo 312th TRS SPINSTRA flight chief SPINSTRA has an innovation lab containing four 3D printers as well as 3D modeling software Although they are unsure of the needs of the 17th Medical Group and surrounding hospitals they plan to continue to create these medical supplies in case they are needed in the future \u201cWe plan to present what we have created to the medical group to see if we can meet their needs and print what they need \u201d said Staff Sgt Jonathan Bahr 312th TRS SPINSTRA instructor Medical professionals wear personal protective equipment to protect themselves and minimize exposure This PPE usually consists of a face mask gloves and goggles or a face shield \u201cThe most realistic option for us to make was the face shields \u201d Bahr said \u201cThe purpose of the face shield is to extend the use of the face mask The goal is to reduce the number of masks being used and thrown out after one use \u201d In the future if more masks and shields are needed to be printed they plan to allow students to begin assisting in this project Instructors have also reached out to other facilities on Goodfellow AFB with 3D printers to provide more medical supplies There are even instructors with personal 3D printers providing more supplies from home \u201cIf we can use our skills to help we plan to do so \u201d Campo said \u201cWe want to do everything we can to help \u201d

why our initial response was \u2018How can we get them connected back with each other and with us \u2019 \u201cLocal committees have all been chatting away on forums and are responding so well to the

or indeed anyone who fancies watching and taking part in community forums before and after the events As well as fortnightly lectures there will be monthly film screenings beginning with one titled Easter in Art There will also be a package of social media training for people who feel they need it The initiative is one of many being launched by museums galleries charities and individual artists to help get people through the lockdown \u201cWe believe the arts have the power to bring people together and we will not let this virus stop communities from enjoying the arts with each other \u201d

and wore face masks at certain points during the ceremony Family and friends were barred from attending and watched a livestream of the ceremony instead That ceremony took place weeks ahead of the initially planned May date in order to minimize risk and get cadets off campus and to their first duty stations The planned June West Point graduation will take place following the outbreak s projected peak for most of the country and around the time that the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation projects that a cautious relaxation of social distancing may be possible But the

veterans who feel they are too old or experienced to re enter higher education or vocational programs because when they return from duty they are a few or several years older than are their peers in class This issue of \u201clost time\u201d is so pervasive that veterans reporting difficulty connecting socially with their school and or other students has become common on campuses across the country Veterans returning from deployment or transitioning out of military service often encounter unique challenges In Military Times reported more than one in six veterans returning from deployment described their readjustment to civilian life \u201cvery difficult\u201d and as of June a study conducted by the Pew Research Center indicated one third of veterans reported trouble paying bills upon returning from deployment Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan in particular were affected with nearly of those veterans reporting mental health difficulties along with financial hardships upon returning to civilian life One way colleges and universities can improve this situation is by offering graduation and or certification pathways that award credit for the skills veterans learn during their military training and deployments Such \u201cbridge\u201d programs shorten the amount of time veterans need to be in school as they transition and critically give veterans solid academic credit for the things they learned while in the military Lansing Community College LCC offers several programs for veterans including the Military Education Training Campus METC Radiologic Technology Bridge Program This program allows veterans and active military personnel to complete an LCC associate degree to fulfill a qualifying requirement of their professional certifications in that field Radiologic technologists are health care professionals who perform diagnostic imaging procedures in medical settings LCC\u2019s METC Radiologic Technology Bridge Program is available online which is important for veterans who may be working caring for family and or are experiencing anxiety post deployment Katrina Steinsultz program director of Radiologic Technology at LCC believes the program offers veterans and active military personnel a clear path to certification and employment Active military and veterans who qualify earn credits for their prior coursework in Radiologic Technology only credits short of their associate degree \u201cMilitary members with training in health care fields may need additional coursework or degrees to obtain necessary certifications or licensures \u201d Steinsultz said \u201cThe Rad Tech METC Bridge Program which can be taken fully online closes the gap between military training and degree attainment Once completed military members have the option to continue their career or seek gainful employment in the civilian sector \u201d LCC accepts applications to its METC Radiologic Technology Bridge Program year round with cohorts beginning in both fall and spring G I Jobs magazine has recognized LCC as a military friendly institution an honor shared by just of nationwide colleges and universities Veterans not trained in radiologic technology who

festivals and events like the IUPUI Regatta Military Park has long been a community gathering space And the state owned green space now serves as almost the front yard to IUPUI s campus said Steve Barnett Marion County s historian He shared some of the park s history with us Created as a training ground for the state militia Military Park wasn t actually inside of the city limits when the land was given to Indiana by the federal government in the early 1820s at the time the city s boundaries ended at West Street And the park was bigger then reaching south to Washington Street When the Indiana Constitution was approved by lawmakers in it stipulated that there are three parcels of land that can never be sold by the state the Soldiers and Sailors Monument the State Capitol and Military Park Later that decade the park was used as the site of the very first state fair The fair took place there most years until the Civil War when the land again became a training area and encampment for soldiers But when the war was over a movement started to rework the land into a park where citizens could come together and enjoy the green space It was revamped to include playground equipment a fountain and a pavilion Barnett said the park was also the site of political rallies and other events then too And the community space proved popular In the early 1900s a state senator introduced a proposal to build a teaching hospital for the Indiana University School of Medicine within the boundaries of the park with the hospital being funded by a gift from Dr Robert W Long The IU trustees agreed with the idea according to a thesis by IUPUI history master s student Amanda Christine Jones The Greatest Outrage Military Park Long Hospital and Progressive Era Notions of Urban Space However Jones wrote then Mayor Samuel Lewis Shank was outraged along with other groups and veterans who touted the park s history as well as the health benefits of public parks and playgrounds They argued that building the hospital there would steal the green space from the city and were ultimately successful when a new location was found for the hospital So the park maintained its function as a gathering space It s had its ups and downs over the years Barnett said noting that there were times when it went neglected But investments in recent decades have made it the park we know today Enjoy the following photos from the Indiana Historical Society that allow you to step back in time and see the early years of the park", "page_url":

for coronavirus will rejoin their flight ranks after they have recovered the top general of the service s training command said Friday Gen Brad Webb head of Air Education and Training Command at Joint Base San Antonio Lackland Texas said that some of those decisions are pending as the program has seen some recruits come down with COVID BMT has had five recruits test positive since increased distancing practices and deep cleaning initiatives began at the base last month Webb said Four have already been cleared to resume training he said noting that they will not have to start their training back at the beginning We do an assessment of where we think affected recruits are with respect to training and they will either rejoin the flight they were originally in or they may be set back a class or two Webb said We go through an assessment of that Related Air Force Shortens Recruit Training Shifts to New Base Amid Pandemic The general said that there have been instances of isolating recruits and Military Training Instructors who had contact with those who presented symptoms or tested positive for the virus But there have been zero instructor positives and zero outbreaks to date thanks in large part to these proactive measures Webb said Trainees or instructors who exhibit symptoms are sequestered and considered persons under investigation or PUI Webb said They are evaluated by medical health professionals and tested for the virus and remain isolated until their tests come back Webb credited procedures implemented in early March including enhanced screening and intervention before processing at military entrance processing stations and adjusted recruit arrival times at Lackland On March AETC began putting new trainees on a day restriction of movement ROM status While in ROM status trainees are housed at the most geographically separated training facilities at JBSA Lackland spokeswoman Jennifer Gonzalez said in a recent email New recruits in ROM status do not have exposure to trainees who have already started the BMT training pipeline Overall class sizes have been whittled down to people due to social distancing requirements previously groups of to recruits would arrive at Lackland each week Earlier this month AETC officials announced two new initiatives for mitigating potential exposure The command reduced the BMT program by one week to a week curriculum and began a proof of concept experiment to begin using Keesler Air Force Base Mississippi as an alternate site for basic training AETC sent new recruits to Keesler on April while remain at Lackland We re doing one group right now until we are satisfied that the proof of concept is successful Webb said Friday So in other words you won t see another recruits coming in week after week

But I refuse to give up on it. - NBCNews.com", "text": "I\u2019ve been dreaming about military service for as long as I can remember I grew up and still live in Lisbon Ohio a tight knit community with strong connections to the armed forces I understand what it means to serve my country \u2014 to commit your life to and fight for something bigger than yourself It\u2019s not only my dream career it\u2019s part of who I am I\u2019ve been training for years to achieve this goal I meet every physical fitness requirement and am fully qualified for service After graduating college I started working with a local recruiter and then enrolled in Army ROTC while starting a graduate program focused on global security But one year ago everything changed I understand what it means to serve my country \u2014 to commit your life to and fight for something bigger than yourself On April the federal government\u2019s new policy banning transgender Americans like me from serving in the military officially went into effect More than anything I felt frustrated and disappointed I had put in so much hard work and made so many sacrifices to participate in ROTC just to be told I was no longer eligible to finish the program And I was disappointed not only for myself but in general that this administration was still pushing so adamantly to keep perfectly qualified capable and patriotic transgender individuals from being able to serve in the military While some of my friends headed off to basic training and others deployed I was left at home to fight a different battle I have remained vigilant in my physical training and preparation and am continuing my master\u2019s program at Kent State In the year since the ban took effect I\u2019ve found another way to serve my community \u2014 as a substitute teacher \u2014 and to serve my family by helping out on our farm When the COVID pandemic shut down the school where I teach I took a temp job at my local Walmart to make ends meet and to support my community as best I can by keeping store shelves stocked with essential items But when I hear the president talk about deploying troops to help in crisis areas the feelings of frustration and sadness rise up again While I am still grappling with how this ban has derailed my life I refuse to give up on my dream And I will continue to fight until every American who meets military standards has an equal opportunity to serve There is nothing about transgender Americans like myself that makes us any less qualified Dedicated transgender service members have proved themselves capable of serving on the front lines and defending our nation with honor But this isn\u2019t just an issue of personal frustration The transgender ban is not only unfair to transgender troops it also undermines national security by discharging trained dedicated service members and depriving the military of well qualified recruits The military has long faced recruitment challenges but the situation is growing more dire under the current pandemic The military is struggling to reach new service members as enlistment stations shutter and has even paused training for new recruits as a precaution against the spread of COVID Despite this our military is being asked to step in to help stem the impacts of the pandemic Responding to a crisis of this magnitude means we need all qualified hands on deck It is inexcusable that the military has spent the last year turning away qualified recruits like me and threatened trained and dedicated transgender service members with discharge I\u2019ve always believed that the military is built on fundamental values of fairness and of respecting people for what they can do I\u2019ve always believed that the military is built on fundamental values of fairness and of respecting people for what they can do regardless of their background or who they are The majority of Americans across the political spectrum already understand this \u2014 and percent support open service by transgender people In my conservative rural community in Ohio teachers coworkers and neighbors with a broad range of political views have all told me they think I should have the same opportunities as anyone else And according to a poll funded by the Department of Defense itself percent of active duty service members across all four branches support the service of transgender people That\u2019s not just a data point \u2014 I\u2019ve heard similar things from former ROTC friends who are now serving For more than a century the military has worked toward abolishing discrimination based on race national origin religion and sexual orientation in their ranks and each time that has made our country safer and stronger I am confident that this ban too will be abolished in the end So as the courts weigh the ultimate fate of the ban and move toward trials in the fall I will continue to train and maintain my fitness I will continue to study and I will continue to speak out so that one day I can say I am proud to wear the uniform of the greatest military on earth Nicolas Talbott Nicolas Talbott is an aspiring service member challenging

Gutierrez enjoyed time competing in and winning beauty pageants Her other passion Playing varsity football for the Falcons Two years after graduating Gutierrez decided to take on another challenge Become the first female infantry to join the army\u2019s 10th mountain division After weeks of grueling training she did just that and is now a SAW gunner Bravo Infantryman and is stationed in Louisiana She was the first woman to ever achieve this title in the army was the first woman in this infantry and is the first Rhode Island woman to achieve the feat as well \u201cI decided to join the military two years after graduating high school I saw it as a challenge there are restrictions between males and females in the army but I found out that they were now allowing women in the infantry so I decided to take that challenge and see what I could do \u201d said Gutierrez Despite having a larger number of women attempting to join the ranks very few have made it since and Gutierrez is proud to be one of them \u201cIt was pretty sweet We were females when we started and only five of us have since graduated A lot of us ended up leaving after a while some of us got medically discharged different things happened Having women in the infantry is still very new they don\u2019t want to separate us I had to do everything that the men had to do to graduate every part of it It was very difficult but it was emotional after weeks of working hard \u201d said Gutierrez It was tough sledding in basic training which included early morning exercise verbal onslaughts by superiors strict schedules etc \u201cThe yelling the waking up at a m every morning to go run the mile runs every Monday and Thursday under minutes the rucking with pounds on your back for miles it\u2019s nonstop The food you ate what you were told you weren\u2019t allowed to go to your room to relax unless you were told that you could do that being away from my family it was a culture shock \u201d said Gutierrez Now as an official member of the infantry Gutierrez is excited to etch her name in history and wants to serve as an example to women everywhere She encourages other women to take on the challenge of joining the military and to have confidence in themselves \u201cMy advice to women would be Remember that your body can handle a lot more than you think it can If you think it\u2019s the last step that you can take I promise you there s one more that you can take after that Basic training is meant to break you you\u2019re supposed to hear the words that you\u2019re awful you\u2019re this you\u2019re that it\u2019s a mind game because your brain has to be able to take that pain physically and emotionally But at the end of the day basic training ends at some point it\u2019s just temporary it\u2019s not the real army until you get there and then it\u2019s what you make it \u201d said Gutierrez who also urges women to explore all facets of the military beyond just positions of combat \u201cThere\u2019s so much more than being a soldier You can be a chef you can be an infantryman like myself you can be an engineer a doctor People expect that you have to be the person carrying around the weapons saving lives but there\u2019s so much more than that \u201d Once Gutierrez completes her military career she plans on returning to Rhode Island She has other goals in mind long term including opening her own restaurant One person that will be ready to welcome her back with open arms is West principal Thomas Barbieri who has been close with her since their time together at Bain Barbieri is thrilled to see his former student serving the country and breaking barriers \u201cI am not surprised at all Carla is a very strong person and she is the definition of what it means to be a Falcon \u201d said Barbieri \u201cShe represents very well the core values and beliefs of the high school She took different opportunities that put her in this place right now

never been afraid to take risks During her time at West Gutierrez enjoyed time competing in and winning beauty pageants Her other passion Playing varsity football for the Falcons Two years after graduating Gutierrez decided to take on another challenge Become the first female infantry to join the army\u2019s 10th mountain division After weeks of grueling training she did just that and is now a SAW gunner Bravo Infantryman and is stationed in Louisiana She was the first woman to ever achieve this title in the army was the first woman in this infantry and is the first Rhode Island woman to achieve the feat as well \u201cI decided to join the military two years after graduating high school I saw it as a challenge there are restrictions between males and females in the army but I found out that they were now allowing women in the infantry so I decided to take that challenge and see what I could do \u201d said Gutierrez Despite having a larger number of women attempting to join the ranks very few have made it since and Gutierrez is proud to be one of them \u201cIt was pretty sweet We were females when we started and only five of us have since graduated A lot of us ended up leaving after a while some of us got medically discharged different things happened Having women in the infantry is still very new they don\u2019t want to separate us I had to do everything that the men had to do to graduate every part of it It was very difficult but it was emotional after weeks of working hard \u201d said Gutierrez It was tough sledding in basic training which included early morning exercise verbal onslaughts by superiors strict schedules etc \u201cThe yelling the waking up at a m every morning to go run the mile runs every Monday and Thursday under minutes the rucking with pounds on your back for miles it\u2019s nonstop The food you ate what you were told you weren\u2019t allowed to go to your room to relax unless you were told that you could do that being away from my family it was a culture shock \u201d said Gutierrez Now as an official member of the infantry Gutierrez is excited to etch her name in history and wants to serve as an example to women everywhere She encourages other women to take on the challenge of joining the military and to have confidence in themselves \u201cMy advice to women would be Remember that your body can handle a lot more than you think it can If you think it\u2019s the last step that you can take I promise you there s one more that you can take after that Basic training is meant to break you you\u2019re supposed to hear the words that you\u2019re awful you\u2019re this you\u2019re that it\u2019s a mind game because your brain has to be able to take that pain physically and emotionally But at the end of the day basic training ends at some point it\u2019s just temporary it\u2019s not the real army until you get there and then it\u2019s what you make it \u201d said Gutierrez who also urges women to explore all facets of the military beyond just positions of combat \u201cThere\u2019s so much more than being a soldier You can be a chef you can be an infantryman like myself you can be an engineer a doctor People expect that you have to be the person carrying around the weapons saving lives but there\u2019s so much more than that \u201d Once Gutierrez completes her military career she plans on returning to Rhode Island She has other goals in mind long term including opening her own restaurant One person that will be ready to welcome her back with open arms is West principal Thomas Barbieri who has been close with her since their time together at Bain Barbieri is thrilled to see his former student serving the country and breaking barriers \u201cI am not surprised at all Carla is a very strong person and she is the definition of what it means to be a Falcon \u201d said Barbieri \u201cShe represents very well the core values and beliefs of the high school She took different opportunities that put her in this place right now She\u2019s one of those kids that when they find their niche when they find what they\u2019re passionate about they go with it Carla did exactly that I\u2019m so

resources is still largely unanswered despite a looming deadline and potentially complicated access issues Beginning Jan all service connected disabled veterans caregivers enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers program and former prisoners of war will be able to shop at on base grocery stores and exchanges They will also be allowed to use some MWR amenities such as golf courses and bowling alleys Congress extended that access as part of National Defense Authorization Act But before shoppers can start using the stores and services the Defense Department needs a plan for easily getting them onto secure military installations The DoD announced early this year that part of its plan relies on letting veterans who hold a Veterans Health Identification Card use it as their base ID card Officials also said they plan to issue access cards to veterans and caregivers who don t hold that form of ID users will be able to receive those cards by presenting a letter of eligibility from the VA Related Millions More Vets and Caregivers Are About to Get Commissary Exchange Access But neither officials with the VA nor the DoD were able to offer access details early this month Although DoD officials initially said they anticipated a policy in hand this week on when and where veterans and caregivers can start applying for the access cards as well as on how bases and commissary stores will manage the expected influx of visitors that rollout has been delayed they said And officials with the VA were unable to say how or when veterans who had received a disability rating through the VA system and caregivers enrolled in the VA s program would be able to access verification letters A VA spokesman referred all questions about access to the

of reincarceration were far greater than the direct costs of providing correctional education\u201d and that education significantly reduces the incidence of reincarceration Tatro who himself has served time notes that less than of BPI students return to prison A Bard Prison Initiative math class in BPI enrolls more than students across six prisons in New York State It is part of Bard College and was founded in PETE MAUNEY Many US prisons offer programs for obtaining a high school equivalency diploma But a high school diploma doesn\u2019t mean someone is college ready and prisons often offer courses to prepare people for college classes Traditionally most programs have focused on humanities criminal justice and related areas Math and science classes are less common The offerings span \u00e0 la carte college credit classes to associate\u2019s and bachelor\u2019s degrees Some classes even include lab experiments For a first hand perspective see the interview with Sean Bearden about how he went from taking correspondence courses while incarcerated to being a physics doctoral student College Behind Bars is a four part documentary series about BPI in New York State that first aired on PBS in BPI is a competitive full time program in which students can earn associate\u2019s and bachelor\u2019s degrees Among the instructors appearing in the series is MIT history professor Craig Steven Wilder who describes how he goes \u201cback to a more basic teaching structure\u201d when he teaches for BPI The students show up \u201cextraordinarily well prepared and so a lot of the sort of gimmickry \u2026 we don\u2019t need here as much because actually everyone\u2019s done the reading \u201d Everything that is brought into prison requires approval In some prisons incarcerated students have to use short golf pencils in others standard pencils are fine Students may have limited computer access Instructors typically use a whiteboard a blackboard or an overhead projector Mixed media are mostly off limits For a biology class at San Quentin instructor Adam Williamson had his students extract DNA from strawberries \u201cWe got permission to bring in the strawberries buffers to break up the cells and chemicals to precipitate DNA \u201d says Williamson who taught there for several years when he was a graduate student before joining the faculty at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania last fall Another experiment involved quantifying aspects of photosynthesis \u201cThe labs worked well \u201d he says \u201cThere was no lack of rigor \u201d Courses in geology and human biology have always been offered through Returning Incarcerated Student Education RISE at Raritan Valley Community College says director Sheila Meiman Started in the RISE program serves seven prisons in New Jersey For human anatomy the models are made of plastic For biology classes instructors bring in compounds that students mix and microscopes with premade plastic slides Calculus based physics she says was \u201csort of our Holy Grail \u201d Raritan Valley\u2019s Peter Stupak guided the modifications to the physics lab equipment to make it acceptable for a prison environment \u201cSeveral items didn\u2019t feel right to our corrections partners \u201d he says \u201cWe modified the list and finally got it to the point where it was acceptable \u201d A strong relationship with the corrections partners is necessary he says The authorized items for physics labs include a plastic car with low friction wheels instead of a massive block and a track made of foam instead of metal measuring tape and protractors made of paper and induction cookers in place of hot plates This drawing was made by students at Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institution in New Jersey Groups of four students prepared lectures on different organs for the physiology section of a biology course in Matthew King taught the course through Princeton University\u2019s Prison Teaching Initiative The

RISE physics class which debuted in January with three students at East Jersey State Prison She volunteers through the university\u2019s Prison Teaching Initiative PTI which coordinates with Raritan Valley for course offerings and college credit Since restrictions were enacted to slow the spread of the coronavirus Halevi\u2019s team and instructors for other courses are completing the semester through written notes worksheets videos of the lab experiments and other distance learning means \u201cThe students have put in so much effort we want to do everything we can to make sure they can finish and get the credit they deserve \u201d Halevi says As a graduate student in biophysics at Princeton Matthew King spotted a feature story about PTI on the university\u2019s homepage and decided to apply \u201cIt was half personal half political \u201d he says He taught environmental science in \u201cWe sat in a semicircle the students were engaged they had done the reading\u2014which is unusual for college students I was hooked \u201d King went on to design experiments and help introduce labs to the PTI program Now a postdoc at Washington University in St Louis he is teaching biology through the school\u2019s prison education program The motivation to study while in prison varies says Mark Krumholz an astrophysicist at Australian National University who has taught at four US prison facilities and cofounded PTI in The program now has two paid administrators and \u2013 volunteers who teach \u2013 courses per semester Some people in prison take courses to pass the time he says Others want to earn a degree in tandem with their children outside or otherwise prove something to their families Many want to prepare for a better future \u201cMost had never really engaged in anything academic \u201d Krumholz says \u201cso the sense of accomplishment they feel when they discover they are good at something is a huge revelation I found that very rewarding \u201d College classes are available in a smattering of county jails in addition to state and federal prisons\u2014wherever programs have sprung up New instructors worry about feeling intimidated in the prisons says PTI director Jill Stockwell \u201cbut the students bend over backwards to make instructors feel safe and respected They know it\u2019s not a comfortable space to come to \u201d Between long drives to prison facilities waits to get in and security measures teaching in prison takes more time than teaching on a college campus Instructors have to work around students missing class and canceled classes due for example to prison lockdowns Communication with incarcerated students outside of class is tricky And class time and duration may have to be scheduled around prison constraints for example at Lockhart Correctional Facility the Texas Prison Education Initiative\u2014which was started in and is supported through donations and crowd funding\u2014offers only evening classes because the prison uses the classroom space in the daytime For their part students have to arrange their study time around lockdowns quarantines crowded conditions noise and prison schedules including frequent head counts In College Behind Bars several students say they study best in the wee hours of the night Many of them work and don\u2019t have much spare time and getting school supplies can be hard \u201cIn New York State prisons everyone has a job\u2014and you have guys sweeping the same hallway It\u2019s a joke \u201d says Tatro BPI students are off the hook for such make work chores Summer Sprofera right graduated from Raritan Valley Community College in August the college\u2019s president Michael McDonough congratulates her She earned her associate\u2019s degree while incarcerated in the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility in Clinton New Jersey Photo provided by Summer Sprofera \u201cPrison is not conducive to getting a college education \u201d says Tatro who got out of the New York State prison system in \u201cYou can\u2019t get research materials in a timely manner you don\u2019t have access to huge libraries there is no internet access Classes are interrupted Professors may assign books but the prison only allows in a cell The list of hurdles is absurd \u201d Tatro learned about BPI by chance from an episode of Minutes that aired in \u201cSeeing that segment allowed me to see myself as a college student \u201d he says It took him six years and repeated prison transfers to finally land in one of the six facilities where the BPI program was offered After his release Tatro completed his bachelor\u2019s degree in math at the main Bard campus in Annandale on Hudson in Since then he has worked for a US congressman and managed a data collection project for a software

trans Tasman \u201ctravel bubble\u201d between the two countries The Australian prime minister Scott Morrison who has been in regular dialogue with other leaders during the pandemic invited Ardern to join Tuesday\u2019s discussion with state premiers last week Australia and New Zealand have both deployed successful strategies to manage the pandemic although New Zealand\u2019s lockdown has been more stringent than Australia\u2019s New Zealand on Monday reported no new cases of Covid for the first time in a month The country has recently eased restrictions from level four to level three

announcements expected on Friday Morrison has been keen to project that Australia is now on a path to easing some of the restrictions and has also pressed for school students to return to classroom learning The states have hastened slowly on reopening schools with Victoria refusing to switch course until the state has conducted mass testing over the next week The federal education minister Dan Tehan launched a swingeing political attack on the Victorian premier Daniel Andrews on Sunday accusing him of taking a \u201csledgehammer\u201d to education Tehan withdrew his comments a couple of hours later after Victoria queried whether he had overstepped the mark and announced it would close a school campus because a teacher had returned a positive test for Covid The federal education minister later blamed the outburst on \u201cfrustration\u201d The closure of schools has been a persistent source of tension between the jurisdictions but Andrews told reporters in Melbourne on Monday

subsidiary Fincantieri Marinette Marine has been selected to provide future guided missile frigates to the US Navy under the FFG X programme beating competition from Austal USA Huntington Ingalls Industries Fincantieri Marine and General Dynamics Bath Iron Works and Lockheed Martin The detailed design and construction contract includes one ship in the current financial year FY and options for up to nine additional vessels with a total value of US 58billion if all options are exercised The cost of construction for vessel number one is estimated at US billion while the following ships are expected to cost US 800m US dollars each though costs for the equipment and armament to be provided are either not or only partially included The first ship is to be delivered months after the contract is awarded with the US Navy expecting the contract to be signed this year Although the Pentagon\u2019s procurement plans specify twenty new generation frigates the Navy has not committed itself to an acquisition strategy beyond the first ten units as it wants to retain the flexibility to order the next batch from another shipyard if necessary something observers note could be done from FY onwards Programme history It is envisaged that FFG X will have air defence anti submarine warfare and surface combat capabilities both near the coast and on the high seas in order to help relieve large surface combat units of routine tasks The programme dates back to and is a reaction by the US Navy to the fact that the Littoral Combat Ships LCS are not fulfilling their originally intended role to the extent expected \u201cFFG X is the further development of the \u2018small\u2019 naval surface unit with increased lethality survivability and improved capability to support the National Defense Strategy across the entire range of military operations It will undoubtedly help us to conduct large scale naval operations more effectively and improve our ability to fight both in contested oceans and near coasts \u201d the Chief of Naval Operations CNO of the US Navy Admiral Michael M Gilday is quoted in US trade media Why Fincantieri The US Navy stipulated that FFG X must be built at a US shipyard and be based on an existing US design or the design of an ally Fincantieri was awarded the contract to build the first unit and the options for the following nine \u2013 not only because key factors favoured the design but as the US Navy expects added value from its adaptability to future technological developments American observers have suggested other aspects besides operational requirements which may have been decisive For one Fincantieri Marinette Marine and Lockheed Martin are already working together on the FREEDOM Class of the LCS with twelve units launched in Marinette so far In the past the shipyard has created growth potential for itself both in terms of infrastructure and finances while export projects have been acquired such as the multi purpose frigates for Saudi Arabia The American election campaign may also cast a shadow as in the presidential election Donald Trump unexpectedly won Wisconsin by a narrow margin of \u2013 a gain of ten electoral votes Additionally a look at the competitors reveals Austal in particular has suffered repetitional damage with its LCS design the INDEPENDENCE class while in addition Australian aluminium shipbuilding is not well received by the US Navy Ingall\u2019s proposal about which little was known may have seemed too far fetched and thus too uncertain in terms of risk management while their shipyard is considered to be working at full capacity The same applies to General Dynamics Bath Iron Works which is also facing imminent strikes imminent while doubts about the stability of their proposal which is based on the Spanish F or \u00c1LVARO DE BAZ\u00c1N class from Navantia may not have been dispelled after the accident involving the Norwegian frigate HELGE INGSTAD also a Navantia design Originally ten shipyards applied for the FFG X programme including Lockheed Martin which announced its withdrawal from the programme in May and Atlas North America with a proposal based on the MEKO A frigate The vessel The French Italian \u201cFregata Europea Multi Missione FREMM design is in service with the French Italian Egyptian and Moroccan navies though variants differ in maximum speed and crew size For example the French Navy plans to have eight FREMMs six ASW and two air defence versions which are considered more automated than their Italian equivalents Italy has ordered ten six in general purpose configuration and four as ASW platforms although the two currently under construction SPARTACO SCHERGAT and EMILIO BIANCHI are now scheduled for delivery to Egypt For Fincantieri the American order represents a success with the Minister of Economics Roberto Gualtieri commenting on the result of the tender in a tweet \u201cThe award of the US Navy tender for ten new

"text": "The Navy on Thursday awarded a much anticipated million contract to a Wisconsin based shipbuilder to begin production on the first of the service s next generation small surface combatants Fincantieri Marinette Marine won the contract to design and build the first of the new guided missile frigates The contract also includes plans for up to nine more ships from the firm a deal that s ultimately worth more than billion The frigate will be an agile multi mission warship James Geurts the assistant secretary of the Navy for research development and acquisition told reporters after the announcement They ll operate in all environments and will be more lethal survivable and have increased self defense and local area defense capability and capacity over previous small surface combatants Related Megadestroyer Zumwalt Delivered to the Navy After Years of Setbacks The new frigate is an important part of the Navy s plans to modernize for more distributed operations positioning the U S to defend against near peer adversaries such as China and Russia Leaders say it will improve the service s ability to fight on both the high seas and near the shore with more capabilities than littoral combat ships but a smaller price tag than cruisers and destroyers The Navy awarded its contract to Fincantieri about three months ahead of schedule in a push to get the new frigate program moving Another way it sped up the process was to build the frigate after an existing ship design Fincantieri beat out three competitors General Dynamics Bath Iron Works Austral USA and Huntington Ingalls Industries with its FREMM design that s already in use by the Italian and French navies FREMM in Italian stands for European multi purpose frigate All this was done with an intense focus on cost acquisition and technical rigor so that we got the best value for our warfighter and the tax pay er Geurts said It s the best I ve seen in the Navy thus far at integrating all of our teams together and it s a model we are building on for future programs The Navy plans to eventually buy of the new frigates Geurts said they expect delivery of the first ship in with the class reaching full operational capability by Since the service is leaning heavily on an existing platform and technologies for the new ship Rear Adm Casey Moton the program executive officer for unmanned and small combatants said he s confident the Navy will meet those timeframes Current plans call for the frigate to use a modified version of the SPY radar Raytheon is developing to keep the Navy s aging destroyers in the fight along with Lockheed Martin s Aegis Combat System Vice Adm Jim Kilby deputy chief of naval operations for warfare requirements and capabilities said the goal is for the frigate to be able to fight in all spectrums of potential conflict That includes being able to carry manned helicopters and unmanned aircraft he said The design criteria also called for lots of space for future upgrades to the ship s systems such as bigger radars or other updates the frigate might need to remain competitive decades from now Though it s classified as a small surface combatant it really falls nicely in between our small surface combatants and our large surface combatants Kilby said And I see it doing multiple things This is going to be a real workhorse for the United States Navy supporting distributed maritime operations in the future Since the Navy has higher survivability standards than European services retired Adm Rick Hunt the former head of Naval Surface Force Pacific who now works for Fincantieri told Defense News last summer that the company added about tons of steel to its FREMM design to qualify to compete for the contract Hunt also told the outlet future crews can expect officer quality when it comes to berthing compartments with private showers in each room The most you ll see in normal steaming is four person staterooms he told Defense News That was a

Now a major Dr Lorenzo Paladino has years of experience as an emergency room doctor and has also been training the pararescuemen of the 106th Rescue Wing s 103rd Rescue Squadron in medical techniques for the past six years In civilian life Paladino is an associate professor of emergency medicine at the State University of New York s Downstate Medical Center and Kings County Hospital Center Research he conducted on the use of a single ventilator to support up to four subjects in was cited in a recent New York Times article on the COVID crisis Paladino also traveled to Washington to discuss his research with federal health officials We are grateful and proud to have Dr Paladino join us said Air Force Lt Col Dr Stephen Rush the 106th Rescue Wing s medical group commander He is a master educator at one of New York City s busiest emergency rooms His clinical skills and research background are a force multiplier for the Air National Guard the Air Force and the pararescue community I want to help those who are helping us \u2014 the soldiers the PJs the airmen I want to help them do their job because they are helping us for the greater good Dr Lorenzo Paladino Paladino said he decided to join the New York Air National Guard s 106th Rescue Wing more than a year ago because he liked the idea of being able to serve in his community while also serving the nation I was always a New Yorker I was born in New York went to school in New York went to med school in New York I did my residency in New York also he said You always have a love for your hometown I think being in New York was a big attraction \u2014 being able to help my hometown Paladino s relationship with the 106th Rescue Wing began when he was teaching Army Special Forces medics at Fort Bragg North Carolina Paladino s journey into medicine started with scuba diving then scuba rescue then becoming a New York City paramedic before deciding on medical school While he was working as a resident in training Special Forces soldiers would rotate through his hospital for training and Paladino as a former paramedic would teach them The pre hospital environment is a different animal he said adding that because he understood that he could share that perspective with the soldiers Eventually he was invited to teach at the Special Forces School where he met Rush Rush in turn got him involved in teaching classes to the Air National Guard pararescuemen known as PJs for short I want to help those who are helping us \u2014 the soldiers the PJs the airmen he said I want to help them do their job because they are helping us for the greater good Along with working in a big city hospital Paladino has operated in austere environments He s worked in the aftermath of earthquakes in Haiti and disasters in South America and has also worked with refugees in Iraq These experiences prepared him for working in now overcrowded emergency rooms in America\u2019s largest city he said I ve been in places where the basics like toilet paper and food were scarce even for us as the rescuers but also where the medical supplies were scarce for us So I ve grown accustomed to working in those environments Paladino said But it is very alien to do that in my own zip code He and other medical colleagues knew the coronavirus hitting China would spread to the United States and worked to get ready Paladino said For those of us who had our finger on the pulse we had a little bit of a heads up he said We could see what the situation was going to look like what the burden was and the equipment that was going to be needed ahead of time The problem he said was that doctors and hospitals in China and Europe were also trying to order the same equipment at the same time His March swearing in to the armed forces was planned before the current health crisis and there was discussion about putting it off or doing it by teleconference the doctor said Instead with downtime being so precious at the moment he decided to come to the wing in person to have the oath of office administered by Lt Col Glyn Weir the commander of the 103rd Rescue Squadron He then carried out his first action as a major that afternoon holding a training session for the 103rd Rescue Squadron s pararescuemen He recalled not answering at first to one of the PJs calling him a major for the first time Oh he s talking to me he recalled The ability to attract people like Paladino to join is what makes the Air National Guard so special said Air Force Col Michael Bank the 106th Rescue Wing commander I am continually amazed at the level of talent and ability we recruit to our team Bank said Dr Lorenzo Paladino has already been making a difference for us as an instructor and we couldn t be happier to
